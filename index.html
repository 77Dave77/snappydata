<p>SnappyData is a <strong>distributed in-memory data store for real-time operational analytics, delivering stream analytics, OLTP (online transaction processing) and OLAP (online analytical processing) in a single integrated cluster</strong>. We realize this platform through a seamless integration of Apache Spark (as a big data computational engine) with GemFire XD (as an in-memory transactional store with scale-out SQL semantics). </p>

<h4 id="building-snappydata-from-source">Building SnappyData from source</h4>
<p>You will find the instructions for building, layout of the code, integration with IDEs using Gradle, etc here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="build-instructions/">SnappyData Build Instructions</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE:
SnappyData is built using Spark 1.6 (build xx) which is packaged as part of SnappyData. While you can build your application using Apache Spark 1.5, you will need to link to Snappy-spark to make  use of the SnappyData extensions. Gradle build tasks are packaged.  </p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="setting-up-passwordless-ssh">Setting up passwordless SSH</h4>
<p>The quick start scripts use ssh to start up various processes. You can install ssh on ubuntu with <code>sudo apt-get install ssh</code>. ssh comes packaged with Mac OSX, however, make sure ssh is enabled by going to <code>System Preferences -&gt; Sharing</code> and enabling <code>Remote Login</code>. Enabling passwordless ssh is the easiest way to work with SnappyData and prevents you from having to put in your ssh password multiple times. </p>
<p>Generate an RSA key with </p>
<p><code>ssh-keygen -t rsa</code></p>
<p>This will spawn some prompts. If you want truly passwordless ssh, just press enter instead of entering a password.</p>
<p>Finally, copy your key to authorized keys:</p>
<p><code>cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code></p>
<p>More detail on passwordless ssh can be found <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys--2">here</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7134535/setup-passphraseless-ssh-to-localhost-on-os-x">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="key-features">Key Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>100% compatible with Spark</strong>: Use SnappyData as a database as well as use any of the Spark APIs - ML, Graph, etc. on the same data</li>
<li><strong>In-memory row and column store</strong>: Run the store collocated in Spark executors (i.e. a single compute and data cluster) or in its own process space (i.e. separate compute and data cluster)</li>
<li><strong>SQL standard compliance</strong>: Spark SQL + several SQL extensions: DML, DDL, indexing, constraints.</li>
<li><strong>SQL based extensions for streaming processing</strong>: Use native Spark streaming, Dataframe APIs or declaratively specify your streams and how you want it processed. No need to learn Spark APIs to get going with stream processing or its subtleties when processing in parallel.</li>
<li><strong>Interactive analytics using Synopsis Data Engine (SDE)</strong>: We introduce multiple synopses techniques through data structures like count-min-sketch and stratified sampling to dramatically reduce in-memory space requirements and provide true interactive speeds for analytic queries. These structures can be created and managed by developers with little to no statistical background and are completely transparent to the SQL developer running queries. Error estimators are also integrated with simple mechanisms to get to the errors through built-in SQL functions. </li>
<li><strong>Mutate, transact on data in Spark</strong>: Use SQL to insert, update, delete data in tables. We also provide extensions to Spark’s context so you can mutate data in your spark programs. Any tables in SnappyData are visible as DataFrames without having to maintain multiples copies of your data. </li>
<li><strong>Optimizations</strong>: Use indexes to improve query performance in the row store (the GemFire SQL optimizer automatically uses in-memory indexes when available) </li>
<li><strong>High availability not just Fault tolerance</strong>: Data is instantly replicated (one at a time or batch at a time) to other nodes in the cluster and is deeply integrated with a membership based distributed system to detect and handle failures instantaneously providing applications with continuous HA.</li>
<li><strong>Durability and recovery:</strong> Data can also be managed on disk and automatically recovered. Utilities for backup and restore are bundled. </li>
</ul>
<p>Read SnappyData <a href="./.">docs</a> for a more detailed list of all features and semantics. </p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>Each header under "Getting Started" that contains a conceptual explanation meant to orient you will append an "(explanation)". Each header that contains actual steps for executing the "Getting Started" will prepend "Step".</p>
<h3 id="objectives">Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>In-memory Column and Row tables</strong>: Illustrate both SQL syntax and the Spark API to create and manage column tables for large data and illustrate how row tables can be used for reference data and can be replicated to each node in the cluster. </li>
<li><strong>OLAP, OLTP operations</strong>: We run analytic class SQL queries (full scan with aggregations) on column tables and fully distributed join queries and observe the space requirements as well as the performance of these queries. For OLTP, we run simple update queries - you can note the Spark API extensions to support mutations in Spark. </li>
<li><strong>SDE</strong>: We run the same analytic queries by creating adjunct stratified samples to note the performance difference - can we get close to interactive query performance speeds?</li>
<li><strong>Streaming with SQL</strong>: We ingest twitter streams into both a probabilistic data structure for TopK time series analytics and the entire stream (full data set) into a row table. We run both ad-hoc queries on these streams (modeled as tables) as well as showcase our first preview for continuous querying support. What SnappyData demonstrates here is simpler, SQL centric abstractions on top of Spark streaming. And, of course, ingestion into the built-in store.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this document, we discuss the features mentioned above and ask you to take steps to run the scripts that demonstrate these features. </p>
<h3 id="snappydata-cluster-explanation">SnappyData Cluster (explanation)</h3>
<p>SnappyData, a database server cluster, has three main components - Locator, Server and Lead. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Locator</strong>: Provides discovery service for the cluster. Informs a new member joining the group about other existing members. A cluster usually has more than one locator for high availability reasons.</li>
<li><strong>Lead Node</strong>: Acts as a Spark driver by maintaining a singleton SparkContext. There is one primary lead node at any given instance but there can be multiple secondary lead node instances on standby for fault tolerance. The lead node hosts a REST server to accept and run applications. The lead node also executes SQL queries routed to it by “data server” members.</li>
<li><strong>Data Servers</strong>: Hosts data, embeds a Spark executor, and also contains a SQL engine capable of executing certain queries independently and more efficiently than Spark. Data servers use intelligent query routing to either execute the query directly on the node, or pass it to the lead node for execution by Spark SQL.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="ClusterArchitecture" src="./GettingStarted_Architecture.png" /></p>
<p>Details of about the architecture can be found here:</p>
<p><a href="architecture/">Architecture</a> </p>
<p>SnappyData also has multiple deployment options which can be found here:</p>
<p><a href="deployment/">Deployment Options</a>.</p>

<p>Click the screenshot below to view the screencast that goes along with "Getting Started with SQL"</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOGQF1wCNes"><img alt="Screencast" src="http://i.imgur.com/uiJ9zzm.png" /></a></p>
<p>The first step is to configure SNAPPY_HOME in your environment:</p>
<p><code>export SNAPPY_HOME=/path/to/snappy/root</code></p>
<p>The remainder of "Getting Started" is based on a set of <a href="http://www.transtats.bts.gov/Fields.asp?Table_ID=236">airline data</a> we run different queries on. That data is packaged with SnappyData, however, it is only a portion of the full dataset. To download the full dataset, from <code>/snappy/</code> run <code>./quickstart/scripts/download_full_airlinedata.sh ./quickstart/data</code>. This is recommended for the Synopsis Data Engine portion of "Getting Started," but not necessary. Note that to run the above script, you need curl installed. <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/259681/the-program-curl-is-currently-not-installed">Here</a> is one way to install it on ubuntu.</p>
<h5 id="passwordless-ssh">Passwordless ssh</h5>
<p>The quick start scripts use ssh to start up various processes. You can install ssh on ubuntu with <code>sudo apt-get install ssh</code>. By default, ssh requires a password. To be able to log on to the localhost and run the script without being prompted for the password, please enable <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7134535/setup-passphraseless-ssh-to-localhost-on-os-x">passwordless ssh</a>. Otherwise, set up ssh for localhost with <code>ssh localhost</code></p>
<p>Navigate to the /snappy/ root directory. The start script starts up a minimal set of essential components to form the cluster - A locator, one data server and one lead node. All nodes are started locally. <strong>Run the start script with:</strong> </p>
<pre><code>./sbin/snappy-start-all.sh
</code></pre>

<p>This may take 30 seconds or more to bootstrap the entire cluster on your local machine (logs are in the 'work' sub-directory). The output should look something like this …</p>
<pre><code>$ sbin/snappy-start-all.sh 
localhost: Starting SnappyData Locator using peer discovery on: 0.0.0.0[10334]
...
localhost: SnappyData Locator pid: 56703 status: running

localhost: Starting SnappyData Server using locators for peer discovery: jramnara-mbpro[10334]   (port used for members to form a p2p cluster)
localhost: SnappyData Server pid: 56819 status: running
localhost:   Distributed system now has 2 members.

localhost: Starting SnappyData Leader using locators for peer discovery: jramnara-mbpro[10334]
localhost: SnappyData Leader pid: 56932 status: running
localhost:   Distributed system now has 3 members.

localhost:   Other members: jramnara-mbpro(56703:locator)&lt;v0&gt;:54414, jramnara-mbpro(56819:datastore)&lt;v1&gt;:39737

</code></pre>

<p>To spin up remote nodes simply rename/copy the files without the template suffix and add the hostnames. View custom configuration and startup options here:</p>
<p><a href="configuration/">Custom Configuration</a></p>
<p>At this point, the SnappyData cluster is up and running and is ready to accept jobs and SQL requests via JDBC/ODBC. You can <a href="http://localhost:4040">monitor the Spark cluster at port 4040</a>. Once you load data and run queries, you can analyze the Spark SQL query plan, the job execution stages and storage details of column tables.</p>

<h3 id="interacting-with-snappydata-explanation">Interacting with SnappyData (explanation)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>For the section on the Spark API, we assume some familiarity with <a href="http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/">core Spark, Spark SQL and Spark Streaming concepts</a>. 
And, you can try out the Spark <a href="http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/quick-start.html">Quick Start</a>. All the commands and programs
listed in the Spark guides will work in SnappyData also. For the section on SQL, no Spark knowledge is necessary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To interact with SnappyData, we provide interfaces for developers familiar with Spark programming as well as SQL. JDBC can be used to connect to the SnappyData cluster and interact using SQL. On the other hand, users comfortable with the Spark programming paradigm can write jobs to interact with SnappyData. Jobs can be like a self contained Spark application or can share state with other jobs using the SnappyData store. </p>
<p>Unlike Apache Spark, which is primarily a computational engine, the SnappyData cluster holds mutable database state in its JVMs and requires all submitted Spark jobs/queries to share the same state (of course, with schema isolation and security as expected in a database). This required extending Spark in two fundamental ways.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Long running executors</strong>: Executors are running within the SnappyData store JVMs and form a p2p cluster.  Unlike Spark, the application Job is decoupled from the executors - submission of a job does not trigger launching of new executors. </li>
<li><strong>Driver runs in HA configuration</strong>: Assignment of tasks to these executors are managed by the Spark Driver.  When a driver fails, this can result in the executors getting shutdown, taking down all cached state with it. Instead, we leverage the <a href="https://github.com/spark-jobserver/spark-jobserver">Spark JobServer</a> to manage Jobs and queries within a "lead" node.  Multiple such leads can be started and provide HA (they automatically participate in the SnappyData cluster enabling HA). 
Read our <a href="./.">docs</a> for details on the architecture.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this document, we showcase mostly the same set of features via the Spark API or using SQL. If you are familiar with Scala and understand Spark concepts you may choose to skip the SQL part go directly to the Spark API section:</p>
<p><a href="#getting-started-with-spark-api"><strong>Getting Started with Spark API</strong></a>.</p>
<h3 id="getting-started-with-sql">Getting Started with SQL</h3>
<p>For SQL, the SnappyData SQL Shell (<em>snappy-shell</em>) provides a simple way to inspect the catalog,  run admin operations,  manage the schema and run interactive queries. You can also use your favorite SQL tool like SquirrelSQL or DBVisualizer (a JDBC connection to the cluster).</p>
<p>From the SnappyData base directory, /snappy/, run: </p>
<pre><code>./bin/snappy-shell
</code></pre>

<p>Connect to the cluster with</p>
<p><code>snappy&gt; connect client 'localhost:1527';</code></p>
<p>You can view connections with</p>
<p><code>snappy&gt; show connections;</code></p>
<p>And check member status with:</p>
<p><code>snappy&gt; show members;</code></p>
<h4 id="column-and-row-tables-explanation">Column and Row tables (explanation)</h4>
<p>Column tables organize and manage data in memory in compressed columnar form such that modern day CPUs can traverse and run computations like a sum or an average really fast (as the values are available in contiguous memory). Column table follows the Spark DataSource access model.</p>
<pre><code class="sql">-- DDL to create a column table
CREATE TABLE AIRLINE (&lt;column definitions&gt;) USING column OPTIONS(buckets '5') ;
</code></pre>

<p>Row tables, unlike column tables, are laid out one row at a time in contiguous memory. Rows are typically accessed using keys. A row's location is determined by a hash function and hence very fast for point lookups or updates.<br />
<em>create table</em> DDL for Row and Column tables allows tables to be partitioned on primary keys, custom partitioned, replicated, carry indexes in memory, persist to disk , overflow to disk, be replicated for HA, etc.  </p>
<pre><code class="sql">-- DDL to create a row table
CREATE TABLE AIRLINEREF (&lt;column definitions&gt;) USING row OPTIONS() ;
</code></pre>

<p>Read our preliminary <a href="rowAndColumnTables/">row &amp; column table docs</a> for the details.</p>
<h4 id="step-2-create-column-table-row-table-and-load-data">Step 2 - Create column table, row table and load data</h4>
<p>The below SQL scripts create and populate the tables we need to continue. The displayed command assumes you started the snappy-shell the base directory, /snappy/. If you started the snappy-shell from /bin/, for example, you need to prepend the filepath with /..</p>
<p>To create and load a column table:</p>
<pre><code>snappy&gt; run './quickstart/scripts/create_and_load_column_table.sql';
</code></pre>

<p>To create and load a row table:</p>
<pre><code>snappy&gt; run './quickstart/scripts/create_and_load_row_table.sql';
</code></pre>

<p>To see the status of the system:</p>
<pre><code>snappy&gt; run './quickstart/scripts/status_queries.sql'
</code></pre>

<p><br>
You can see the memory consumed in the Spark Console, http://<code>&lt;the-lead-host-name</code>&gt;`:4040/Snappy Store. </p>
<h4 id="olap-and-oltp-queries-explanation">OLAP and OLTP queries (explanation)</h4>
<p>SQL client connections (via JDBC or ODBC) are routed to the appropriate data server via the locator (Physical connections are automatically created in the driver and are transparently swizzled in case of failures also). When queries are executed they are parsed initially by the SnappyData server to determine if the query is an OLAP class or an OLTP class query.  Currently, all column table queries are considered OLAP.  Such queries are routed to the <strong>lead</strong> node where a <strong>Spark SQLContext</strong> is managed for each connection. The query is planned using Spark's Catalyst engine and scheduled to be executed on the data servers. The number of partitions determine the number of concurrent tasks used across the data servers to run the query in parallel. In this case, our column table was created using <em>5 partitions (buckets)</em> and hence will use 5 concurrent tasks. </p>
<pre><code class="sql">---- Which Airlines Arrive On Schedule? JOIN with reference table ----
snappy&gt; select AVG(ArrDelay) arrivalDelay, description AirlineName, UniqueCarrier carrier 
  from airline, airlineref
  where airline.UniqueCarrier = airlineref.Code
  group by UniqueCarrier, description 
  order by arrivalDelay;
</code></pre>

<p>For low latency OLTP queries, the engine won't route it to the lead and instead execute it immediately without any scheduling overhead. Quite often, this may mean simply fetching a row by hashing a key (in microseconds).</p>
<pre><code class="sql">--- Suppose a particular Airline company say 'Delta Air Lines Inc.' re-brands itself as 'Delta America'
--- the airline code can be updated in the row table
UPDATE AIRLINEREF SET DESCRIPTION='Delta America' WHERE CAST(CODE AS VARCHAR(25))='DL';
</code></pre>

<p>Spark SQL can cache DataFrames as temporary tables and the data set is immutable. SnappyData SQL is compatible with the SQL standard with support for transactions and DML (insert, update, delete) on tables. <a href="http://gemfirexd.docs.pivotal.io/docs-gemfirexd/reference/sql-language-reference.html">Link to Snappy Store SQL reference</a>.  As we show later, any table in SnappyData is also visible as a Spark DataFrame. </p>
<h4 id="step-3-run-olap-and-oltp-queries">Step 3 - Run OLAP and OLTP queries</h4>
<p>The OLAP query we're executing is asking "which airlines arrive on schedule?" which requires a join to a reference table. You have the option to run the packaged query script or paste one query at a time. To run the script, in the snappy-shell paste:</p>
<pre><code>snappy&gt; run './quickstart/scripts/olap_queries.sql';
</code></pre>

<p>To paste the actual query, paste:</p>
<pre><code class="sql">select AVG(ArrDelay) arrivalDelay, description AirlineName, UniqueCarrier carrier 
  from airline, airlineref
  where airline.UniqueCarrier = airlineref.Code
  group by UniqueCarrier, description 
  order by arrivalDelay;
</code></pre>

<p>Each query is executed as one or more Jobs and each Job executed in one or more stages. You can explore the query execution plan and metrics <a href="http://localhost:4040/SQL/">the Spark Console</a> under "SQL."</p>
<p>The OLTP query we're executing is updating "Delta Airlines" to "Delta America." Paste the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="sql">snappy&gt; run './quickstart/scripts/oltp_queries.sql';
</code></pre>

<p>You can now re-run olap_queries.sql to see the updated join result set.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>
In the current implementation we only support appending to Column tables. Future releases will support all DML operations. 
You can execute transactions using commands <em>autocommit off</em> and <em>commit</em>.  </p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="synopsis-data-engine-sde-explanation">Synopsis Data Engine (SDE) (explanation)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>If you downloaded the full airline data (52 million records) set in <a href="#step-1---start-the-snappydata-cluster">Step 1</a>, edit the <code>'create_and_load_column_table.sql'</code> script which is in <code>quickstart/scripts</code> to point to <code>airlineParquetData_2007-15</code> directory. Make sure you copy + paste the starting quote mark to the end after you change <code>airlineParquetData</code> to enclose the statement. If you enter a quote mark directly from your keyboard it may break the script.  This script loads parquet formatted data into a temporary spark table then saves it in column table called Airline. You need to load the table again using <code>run './quickstart/scripts/create_and_load_column_table.sql';</code> Ideally, you'd re-run the olap queries script as well to see the speedup between non-SDE and SDE. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>OLAP queries are expensive as they require traversing through large data sets and shuffling data across nodes. While the in-memory queries above executed in less than a second the response times typically would be much higher with very large data sets. On top of this, concurrent execution for multiple users would also slow things down. Achieving interactive query speed in most analytic environments requires drastic new approaches like SDE.
Similar to how indexes provide performance benefits in traditional databases, SnappyData provides APIs and DDL to specify one or more curated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratified_sampling">stratified samples</a> on large tables. </p>
<p>The following DDL creates a sample that is 3% of the full data set and stratified on 3 columns. The commonly used dimensions in your <em>Group by</em> and <em>Where</em> clauses make up the <em>Query Column Set</em> (strata columns). Multiple samples can be created and queries that are executed on the base table are analyzed for appropriate sample selection. </p>
<pre><code class="sql">CREATE SAMPLE TABLE AIRLINE_SAMPLE
   ON AIRLINE                             -- The parent base table
   OPTIONS(
    buckets '5',                          -- Number of partitions 
    qcs 'UniqueCarrier, Year_, Month_',   -- QueryColumnSet(qcs): The strata - 3% of each combination of Carrier, 
                                          -- Year and Month are stored as sample
    fraction '0.03',                      -- How big should the sample be
    strataReservoirSize '50'              -- Reservoir sampling to support streaming inserts
</code></pre>

<p>You can run queries directly on the sample table (stored in columnar format) or on the base table. For base table queries you have to specify the <em>With Error</em> constraint indicating to the SnappyData Query processor that a sample can be substituted for the full data set. </p>
<pre><code class="sql">-- What is the average arrival delay for all airlines for each month?;
snappy&gt; select avg(ArrDelay), Month_ from Airline where ArrDelay &gt;0 
    group by Month_
    with error;
-- The above query will consult the sample and return an answer if the estimated answer 
-- is at least 90% accurate (here, by default we use a 95% confidence interval).

-- You can also access the error using built-in functions. 
snappy&gt; select avg(ArrDelay) avgDelay, absolute_error(avgDelay), Month_ 
    from Airline where ArrDelay &gt;0 
    group by Month_
    with error;
</code></pre>

<h4 id="step-4-create-load-and-query-sample-table">Step 4 - Create, Load and Query Sample Table</h4>
<p>Like Step 3, we need to first create and load the sample table. The following script will sample the Airline table:</p>
<pre><code>snappy&gt; run './quickstart/scripts/create_and_load_sample_table.sql';
</code></pre>

<p>You can now re-run the previous OLAP queries with an error constraint and compare the results. The following script will run the previous queries with an error constraint:</p>
<pre><code>snappy&gt; run './quickstart/scripts/olap_approx_queries.sql';
</code></pre>

<p>You should notice a 10X or larger difference in query execution latency while the results remain nearly as accurate. As a reminder, we recommend downloading the larger data set for this exercise.</p>
<h4 id="stream-analytics-using-sql-and-spark-streaming-explanation">Stream analytics using SQL and Spark Streaming (explanation)</h4>
<p>SnappyData extends Spark streaming so stream definitions can be declaratively written using SQL and you can analyze these streams using SQL. You can also dynamically run SQL queries on these streams. There is no need to learn Spark streaming APIs or statically define all the rules to be executed on these streams.</p>
<p>The commands below consume tweets, then they filter out just the hashtags and then they convert hashtags into Row objects. The commands then model the stream as a table (so it can be queried) and we then run ad-hoc SQL from remote clients on the current state of the stream. </p>
<pre><code class="sql">--- Inits the Streaming Context with the batch interval of 2 seconds.
--- i.e. the stream is processed once every 2 seconds.
snappy&gt; STREAMING INIT 2 SECS;
--- Create a stream table just containing the hashtags.
--- /tmp/copiedtwitterdata is the directory that Streaming will use to find and read new text files.
--- We use quickstart/scripts/simulateTwitterStream script in below example to simulate a twitter stream by
--- copying tweets in /tmp/copiedtwitterdata folder.
snappy&gt; CREATE STREAM TABLE HASHTAG_FILESTREAMTABLE
              (hashtag string)
            USING file_stream
            OPTIONS (storagelevel 'MEMORY_AND_DISK_SER_2',
              rowConverter 'org.apache.spark.sql.streaming.TweetToHashtagRow',
              directory '/tmp/copiedtwitterdata')
--- A file_stream data source monitors the directory and as files arrives they are ingested
--- into the streaming pipeline. First converted into Rows using 'TweetToHashtagRow' then visible as table
--- Start streaming context 
snappy&gt; STREAMING START
--- Adhoc sql on the stream table to query the current batch
--- Get top 10 popular hashtags ----
snappy&gt; SELECT hashtag, count(*) as tagcount
        FROM HASHTAG_FILESTREAMTABLE
        GROUP BY hashtag
        ORDER BY tagcount DESC limit 10;
</code></pre>

<p>Later, in the Spark API section we further enhance this concept to showcase <a href="#stream-analytics-using-spark-streaming-explanation">"continuous queries" (CQ)</a>. Dynamic registration of CQs (from remote clients) will be available in the next release.</p>
<h4 id="top-k-elements-in-a-stream-explanation">Top-K Elements in a Stream (explanation)</h4>
<p>Finding the <em>k</em> most popular elements in a data stream is a common analytic query. For instance, the top-100 pages on a popular website in the last 10 mins, the top-10 sales regions in the last week, etc. As you can see, if the query is on an arbitrary time interval in the past, this will most likely mandate storing the entire stream. And, this could easily be millions to billions of events in use cases in the Internet of Things, for example. SnappyData provides SQL extensions to Spark to maintain top-k approximate structures on streams. Also, SnappyData adds a temporal component (i.e. data can be queried based on a time interval) to these structures and enables transparent querying using Spark SQL. More details about SnappyData's implementation of top-k can be found here:</p>
<p><a href="aqp/">Detailed SDE Documentation</a></p>
<p>SnappyData provides DDL extensions to create Top-k structures. And, if a stream table is specified as base table, the Top-k structure is automatically populated from it as data arrives. The Top-k structures can be queried using regular SQL queries. </p>
<pre><code class="sql">--- Create a topk table from a stream table
CREATE TOPK TABLE filestream_topktable ON HASHTAG_FILESTREAMTABLE OPTIONS
(key 'hashtag', timeInterval '2000ms', size '10' );
--- Query a topk table 
SELECT hashtag, COUNT(hashtag) AS TopKCount
FROM filestream_topktable
GROUP BY hashtag ORDER BY TopKCount limit 10;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, lets try analyzing some tweets using this above syntax in real time using SnappyData's packaged scripts.</p>
<h4 id="step-5-create-and-query-stream-table-and-top-k-declaratively">Step 5 - Create and Query Stream Table and Top-K Declaratively</h4>
<p>You can use the scripts that simulates the twitter stream by copying pre-loaded tweets in a tmp folder. Or, you could use a script that accesses the live twitter stream.  </p>
<h5 id="steps-to-work-with-simulated-twitter-stream">Steps to work with simulated Twitter stream</h5>
<p>Create a file stream table that listens on a folder and then start the streaming context. In the snappy-shell, paste:</p>
<pre><code class="sql">snappy&gt; run './quickstart/scripts/create_and_start_file_streaming.sql';
</code></pre>

<p>Run the following utility in another terminal that simulates a twitter stream by copying tweets in the folder on which file stream table is listening.</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ quickstart/scripts/simulateTwitterStream 
</code></pre>

<p>Now query the current batch of the stream using the following script. </p>
<pre><code class="sql">--- Run this command multiple times to query current batch at different times 
run './quickstart/scripts/file_streaming_query.sql';
--- Stop the streaming 
snappy&gt; STREAMING STOP;
</code></pre>

<p>This also creates Topk structures. simulateTwitterStream script runs for only for a minute or so.</p>
<h5 id="steps-to-work-with-live-twitter-stream">Steps to work with live Twitter stream</h5>
<p>To work with the live twitter stream, you will have to generate authorization keys and secrets on <a href="https://apps.twitter.com/">twitter apps</a> and update <code>SNAPPY_HOME/quickstart/scripts/create_and_start_twitter_streaming.sql</code> with the keys and secrets.</p>
<pre><code class="sql">--- Run the create and start script that has keys and secrets to fetch live twitter stream
--- Note: Currently, we do not encrypt the keys. 
-- This also creates Topk structures
snappy&gt; run './quickstart/scripts/create_and_start_twitter_streaming.sql';
</code></pre>

<p>Now query the current batch of the stream using the following script. </p>
<pre><code class="sql">--- Run this command multiple times to query current batch at different times 
snappy&gt; run './quickstart/scripts/twitter_streaming_query.sql';
--- Stop the streaming 
snappy&gt; STREAMING STOP;

<h3 id="getting-started-with-spark-api">Getting Started with Spark API</h3>
<p><a href="http://snappydatainc.github.io/snappydata/apidocs/#org.apache.spark.sql.SnappyContext">SnappyContext</a> is the main entry point for SnappyData extensions to Spark. A SnappyContext extends Spark's <a href="http://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.0/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.sql.SQLContext">SQLContext</a> to work with Row and Column tables. Any DataFrame can be managed as a SnappyData table and any table can be accessed as a DataFrame. This is similar to <a href="http://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.0/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.sql.hive.HiveContext">HiveContext</a> and it integrates the SQLContext functionality with the SnappyData store. Similarly, <a href="http://snappydatainc.github.io/snappydata/apidocs/#org.apache.spark.sql.streaming.SnappyStreamingContext">SnappyStreamingContext</a> is an entry point for SnappyData extensions to Spark Streaming and it extends Spark's <a href="http://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.0/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.streaming.StreamingContext">Streaming Context</a>. </p>
<p>Applications typically submit Jobs to SnappyData and do not explicitly create a SnappyContext or SnappyStreamingContext. These jobs are the primary mechanism to interact with SnappyData using the Spark API. A job implements either SnappySQLJob or SnappyStreamingJob (for streaming applications) trait. </p>
<pre><code class="scala">class SnappySampleJob implements SnappySQLJob {
  /** Snappy uses this as an entry point to execute Snappy jobs. **/
  def runJob(snc: SnappyContext, jobConfig: Config): Any

  /** SnappyData calls this function to validate the job input and reject invalid job requests **/
  def validate(sc: SnappyContext, config: Config): SparkJobValidation
}
</code></pre>

<p>The implementation of the <em>runJob</em> function from SnappySQLJob uses a SnappyContext to interact with the SnappyData store to process and store tables. The implementation of runJob from SnappyStreamingJob uses a SnappyStreamingContext to create streams and manage the streaming context. The jobs are submitted to the lead node of SnappyData over REST API using a <em>spark-submit</em> like utility. See more details about jobs here:</p>

<h4 id="synopsis-data-engine-sde-explanation_1">Synopsis Data Engine (SDE) (explanation)</h4>
<p>OLAP jobs are expensive as they require traversing through large data sets and shuffling data across nodes. While the in-memory jobs above executed in less than a second, the response times typically would be much higher with very large data sets. On top of this, concurrent execution for multiple users would also slow things down. Achieving interactive query speed in most analytic environments requires drastic new approaches like SDE.
Similar to how indexes provide performance benefits in traditional databases, SnappyData provides APIs to specify one or more curated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratified_sampling">stratified samples</a> on large tables. </p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="note">Note</h4>
<p>We recommend downloading the full dataset mentioned in <a href="#step-1---start-the-snappydata-cluster">Step 1</a> which is about 52 million records. With the above data set (1 million rows) only about a third of the time is spent in query execution engine and  sampling is unlikely to show much of any difference in speed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following scala code creates a sample that is 3% of the full data set and stratified on 3 columns. The commonly used dimensions in your <em>Group by</em> and <em>Where</em> clauses make up the <em>Query Column Set</em> (strata columns). Multiple samples can be created and queries executed on the base table are analyzed for appropriate sample selection. </p>
<pre><code class="scala">val sampleDF = snappyContext.createTable(sampleTable, Some(&quot;Airline&quot;),
        &quot;column_sample&quot;, // DataSource provider for sample tables
        updatedSchema, Map(&quot;buckets&quot; -&gt; &quot;5&quot;,
          &quot;qcs&quot; -&gt; &quot;UniqueCarrier, Year_, Month_&quot;,
          &quot;fraction&quot; -&gt; &quot;0.03&quot;,
          &quot;strataReservoirSize&quot; -&gt; &quot;50&quot;
        ))
</code></pre>

<p>You can run queries directly on the sample table (stored in columnar format) or on the base table. For base table queries you have to specify the <em>With Error</em> constraint indicating to the SnappyData Query processor that a sample can be substituted for the full data set. </p>
<pre><code class="scala">// Query Snappy Store's Sample table :Which Airlines arrive On schedule? JOIN with reference table
sampleResult = sampleDF.join(airlineCodeDF,
        sampleDF.col(&quot;UniqueCarrier&quot;).equalTo(airlineCodeDF(&quot;CODE&quot;))).
          groupBy(sampleDF(&quot;UniqueCarrier&quot;), airlineCodeDF(&quot;DESCRIPTION&quot;)).
          agg(&quot;ArrDelay&quot; -&gt; &quot;avg&quot;).orderBy(&quot;avg(ArrDelay)&quot;)

 // Query Snappy Store's Airline table with error clause.
airlineDF.groupBy(airlineDF(&quot;Month_&quot;))
  .agg(&quot;ArrDelay&quot; -&gt; &quot;avg&quot;)
  .orderBy(&quot;Month_&quot;).withError(0.05,0.95)

<h4 id="stream-analytics-using-spark-streaming-explanation">Stream analytics using Spark Streaming (explanation)</h4>
<p>SnappyData extends Spark streaming so stream definitions can be declaratively written using SQL and streams can be analyzed using SQL. Also, SnappyData introduces "continuous queries" (CQ) on the stream. One can define a continous query as a SQL query on the stream with window and slide extensions which is returned as SchemaDStream i.e. DStream with schema. SnappyData's extensions provide functionality to insert a SchemaDStream into the SnappyData store. </p>
<p>Dynamic registration of CQs (from remote clients) will be available in the next release.</p>
<pre><code class="scala">// create a stream table declaratively 
snsc.sql(&quot;CREATE STREAM TABLE RETWEETTABLE (retweetId long, &quot; +
    &quot;retweetCnt int, retweetTxt string) USING file_stream &quot; +
    &quot;OPTIONS (storagelevel 'MEMORY_AND_DISK_SER_2', &quot; +
    &quot;rowConverter 'org.apache.spark.sql.streaming.TweetToRetweetRow',&quot; +
    &quot;directory '/tmp/copiedtwitterdata')&quot;);

// Register a continous query on the stream table with window and slide parameters
val retweetStream: SchemaDStream = snsc.registerCQ(&quot;SELECT retweetId, retweetCnt FROM RETWEETTABLE &quot; +
    &quot;window (duration '2' seconds, slide '2' seconds)&quot;)

// Create a row table to hold the retweets based on their id 
snsc.snappyContext.sql(s&quot;CREATE TABLE $tableName (retweetId bigint PRIMARY KEY, &quot; +
    s&quot;retweetCnt int, retweetTxt string) USING row OPTIONS ()&quot;)

// Iterate over the stream and insert it into snappy store
retweetStream.foreachDataFrame(df =&gt; {
    df.write.insertInto(tableName)
})
</code></pre>

<h4 id="top-k-elements-in-a-stream-explanation_1">Top-K Elements in a Stream (explanation)</h4>
<p>Continuously finding the <em>k</em> most popular elements in a data stream is a common analytic query. SnappyData provides extensions to Spark to maintain top-k approximate structures on streams. Also, SnappyData adds a temporal component (i.e. data can be queried based on a time interval) to these structures. More details about SnappyData's implementation of top-k can be found here:</p>
<p><a href="aqp/">SnappyData's SDE Docs</a></p>
<p>SnappyData provides an API in the <a href="http://snappydatainc.github.io/snappydata/apidocs/#org.apache.spark.sql.SnappyContext">SnappyContext</a> to create a Top-k structure. And, if a stream table is specified as the base table, the Top-k structure is automatically populated from it as the data arrives. The Top-k structures can be queried using another API. </p>
<pre><code class="scala">--- Create a topk table from a stream table
snappyContext.createApproxTSTopK(&quot;topktable&quot;, Some(&quot;hashtagTable&quot;), &quot;hashtag&quot;,
    Some(schema), Map(
      &quot;epoch&quot; -&gt; System.currentTimeMillis().toString,
      &quot;timeInterval&quot; -&gt; &quot;2000ms&quot;,
      &quot;size&quot; -&gt; &quot;10&quot;
    ))
--- Query a topk table for the last two seconds
val topKDF = snappyContext.queryApproxTSTopK(&quot;topktable&quot;,
                System.currentTimeMillis - 2000,
                System.currentTimeMillis)

<p>SnappyData, out-of-the-box, collocates Spark executors and the SnappyData store for efficient data intensive computations. But it may be desirable to isolate the computational cluster for other reasons, for instance, a  computationally intensive Map-reduce machine learning algorithm that needs to iterate over a cached data set repeatedly. To support such scenarios it is also possible to run native Spark jobs that access a SnappyData cluster as a storage layer in a parallel fashion. </p>
<pre><code class="bash"># Start the spark shell in local mode. Pass SnappyData's locators host:port as a conf parameter.
# Change the UI port because the default port 4040 is being used by Snappy’s lead. 
$ bin/spark-shell  --master local[*] --conf snappydata.store.locators=localhost:10334 --conf spark.ui.port=4041
scala&gt;
Try few commands on the spark-shell 

# fetch the tables and using sqlContext which is going to be an instance of SnappyContext in this case
scala&gt; val airlinerefDF = sqlContext.table(&quot;airlineref&quot;).show
scala&gt; val airlineDF = sqlContext.table(&quot;airline&quot;).show
