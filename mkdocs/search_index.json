We realize this platform through a seamless integration of Apache Spark (as a big data computational engine) with GemFire XD (as an in-memory transactional store with scale-out SQL semantics). \n\n\n\n\nDownload binary distribution\n\n\nYou can download the latest version of SnappyData here:\n\n\n\n\nSnappyData Preview 0.1 download link\n\n\n\n\nSnappyData has been tested on Linux (mention kernel version) and Mac OSX. If not already installed, you will need to download scala 2.10 and \nJava 8\n. \n\n\nSkip to Getting Started\n\n\nCommunity Support\n\n\nWe monitor channels listed below for comments/questions.\n\n\nStackoverflow\n \n    \nSlack\n        Gitter \n          \nIRC\n \n             \nReddit\n \n          JIRA \n\n\nLink with SnappyData distribution\n\n\nSnappyData artifacts are hosted in Maven Central. You can add a Maven dependency with the following coordinates:\n\n\ngroupId: io.snappydata\nartifactId: snappydata_2.10\nversion: 0.1_preview\n\n\n\n\nWorking with SnappyData Source Code\n\n\nIf you are interested in working with the latest code or contributing to SnappyData development, you can also check out the master branch from Git:\n\n\nMaster development branch\ngit clone https://github.com/SnappyDataInc/snappydata.git\n\n###### 0.1 preview release branch with stability fixes ######\ngit clone https://github.com/SnappyDataInc/snappydata.git -b 0.1_preview\n\n\n\n\nBuilding SnappyData from source\n\n\nYou will find the instructions for building, layout of the code, integration with IDEs using Gradle, etc here:\n\n\n\n\nSnappyData Build Instructions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE:\nSnappyData is built using Spark 1.6 (build xx) which is packaged as part of SnappyData. While you can build your application using Apache Spark 1.5, you will need to link to Snappy-spark to make  use of the SnappyData extensions. Gradle build tasks are packaged.  \n\n\n\n\nKey Features\n\n\n\n\n100% compatible with Spark\n: Use SnappyData as a database as well as use any of the Spark APIs - ML, Graph, etc. on the same data\n\n\nIn-memory row and column store\n: Run the store collocated in Spark executors (i.e. a single compute and data cluster) or in its own process space (i.e. separate compute and data cluster)\n\n\nSQL standard compliance\n: Spark SQL + several SQL extensions: DML, DDL, indexing, constraints.\n\n\nSQL based extensions for streaming processing\n: Use native Spark streaming, Dataframe APIs or declaratively specify your streams and how you want it processed. No need to learn Spark APIs to get going with stream processing or its subtleties when processing in parallel.\n\n\nInteractive analytics using Approximate Query Processing (AQP)\n: We introduce multiple synopses techniques through data structures like count-min-sketch and stratified sampling to dramatically reduce in-memory space requirements and provide true interactive speeds for analytic queries. These structures can be created and managed by developers with little to no statistical background and are completely transparent to the SQL developer running queries. Error estimators are also integrated with simple mechanisms to get to the errors through built-in SQL functions. \n\n\nMutate, transact on data in Spark\n: Use SQL to insert, update, delete data in tables. We also provide extensions to Spark\u2019s context so you can mutate data in your spark programs. Any tables in SnappyData are visible as DataFrames without having to maintain multiples copies of your data. \n\n\nOptimizations\n: Use indexes to improve query performance in the row store (the GemFire SQL optimizer automatically uses in-memory indexes when available) \n\n\nHigh availability not just Fault tolerance\n: Data is instantly replicated (one at a time or batch at a time) to other nodes in the cluster and is deeply integrated with a membership based distributed system to detect and handle failures instantaneously providing applications with continuous HA.\n\n\nDurability and recovery:\n Data can also be managed on disk and automatically recovered. Utilities for backup and restore are bundled. \n\n\n\n\nRead SnappyData \ndocs\n for a more detailed list of all features and semantics. \n\n\nGetting started\n\n\nEach header under \"Getting Started\" that contains conceptual information meant to orient you will append a \"(conceptual)\". Each header that contains actual steps for executing the \"Getting Started\" will prepend \"Step\".\n\n\nObjectives\n\n\n\n\nIn-memory Column and Row tables\n: Illustrate both SQL syntax and the Spark API to create and manage column tables for large data and illustrate how row tables can be used for reference data and can be replicated to each node in the cluster. \n\n\nOLAP, OLTP operations\n: We run analytic class SQL queries (full scan with aggregations) on column tables and fully distributed join queries and observe the space requirements as well as the performance of these queries. For OLTP, we run simple update queries - you can note the Spark API extensions to support mutations in Spark. \n\n\nAQP\n: We run the same analytic queries by creating adjunct stratified samples to note the performance difference - can we get close to interactive query performance speeds?\n\n\nStreaming with SQL\n: We ingest twitter streams into both a probabilistic data structure for TopK time series analytics and the entire stream (full data set) into a row table. We run both ad-hoc queries on these streams (modeled as tables) as well as showcase our first preview for continuous querying support. What SnappyData demonstrates here is simpler, SQL centric abstractions on top of Spark streaming. And, of course, ingestion into the built-in store.\n\n\n\n\nIn this document, we discuss the features mentioned above and ask you to take steps to run the scripts that demonstrate these features. \n\n\nSnappyData Cluster (conceptual)\n\n\nSnappyData, a database server cluster, has three main components - Locator, Server and Lead. \n\n\n\n\nLocator\n: Provides discovery service for the cluster. Informs a new member joining the group about other existing members. A cluster usually has more than one locator for high availability reasons.\n\n\nLead Node\n: Acts as a Spark driver by maintaining a singleton SparkContext. There is one primary lead node at any given instance but there can be multiple secondary lead node instances on standby for fault tolerance. The lead node hosts a REST server to accept and run applications. The lead node also executes SQL queries routed to it by \u201cdata server\u201d members.\n\n\nData Servers\n: Hosts data, embeds a Spark executor, and also contains a SQL engine capable of executing certain queries independently and more efficiently than Spark. Data servers use intelligent query routing to either execute the query directly on the node, or pass it to the lead node for execution by Spark SQL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetails of about the architecture can be found here:\n\n\nArchitecture\n \n\n\nSnappyData also has multiple deployment options which can be found here:\n\n\nDeployment Options\n.\n\n\nStep 1 - Start the SnappyData cluster\n\n\nThe first step is to configure SNAPPY_HOME in your environment:\n\n\nexport SNAPPY_HOME=/path/to/snappy/root\n\n\nThe remainder of \"Getting Started\" is based on a set of \nairline data\n we run different queries on. That data is packaged with SnappyData, however, it is only a portion of the full dataset. To download the full dataset, from \nsnappy/quickstart/scripts\n run \n./quickstart/scripts/download_full_airlinedata.sh ./quickstart/data\n. This is recomended for the approximate query processing portion of \"Getting Started,\" but not necessary.\n\n\nPasswordless ssh\n\n\nThe quick start scripts use ssh to start up various processes. You can install ssh on ubuntu with \nsudo apt-get install ssh\n. By default, ssh requires a password. To be able to log on to the localhost and run the script without being prompted for the password, please enable \npasswordless ssh\n. Otherwise, set up ssh for localhost with \nssh localhost\n\n\nNavigate to the /snappy/ root directory. The start script starts up a minimal set of essential components to form the cluster - A locator, one data server and one lead node. All nodes are started locally. \nRun the start script with:\n \n\n\n./sbin/snappy-start-all.sh\n\n\n\n\nIt should roughly take up to a minute and look like this (logs are in the 'work' sub-directory):\n\n\n$ sbin/snappy-start-all.sh \nlocalhost: Starting SnappyData Locator using peer discovery on: 0.0.0.0[10334]\n...\nlocalhost: SnappyData Locator pid: 56703 status: running\n\nlocalhost: Starting SnappyData Server using locators for peer discovery: jramnara-mbpro[10334]   (port used for members to form a p2p cluster)\nlocalhost: SnappyData Server pid: 56819 status: running\nlocalhost:   Distributed system now has 2 members.\n\nlocalhost: Starting SnappyData Leader using locators for peer discovery: jramnara-mbpro[10334]\nlocalhost: SnappyData Leader pid: 56932 status: running\nlocalhost:   Distributed system now has 3 members.\n\nlocalhost:   Other members: jramnara-mbpro(56703:locator)\nv0\n:54414, jramnara-mbpro(56819:datastore)\nv1\n:39737\n\n\n\n\n\nTo spin up remote nodes simply rename/copy the files without the template suffix and add the hostnames. View custom configuration and startup options here:\n\n\nCustom Configuration\n\n\nAt this point, the SnappyData cluster is up and running and is ready to accept jobs and SQL requests via JDBC/ODBC. You can \nmonitor the Spark cluster at port 4040\n. Once you load data and run queries, you can analyze the Spark SQL query plan, the job execution stages and storage details of column tables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteracting with SnappyData (conceptual)\n\n\n\n\nFor the section on the Spark API, we assume some familiarity with \ncore Spark, Spark SQL and Spark Streaming concepts\n. \nAnd, you can try out the Spark \nQuick Start\n. All the commands and programs\nlisted in the Spark guides will work in SnappyData also. For the section on SQL, no Spark knowledge is necessary.\n\n\n\n\nTo interact with SnappyData, we provide interfaces for developers familiar with Spark programming as well as SQL. JDBC can be used to connect to the SnappyData cluster and interact using SQL. On the other hand, users comfortable with the Spark programming paradigm can write jobs to interact with SnappyData. Jobs can be like a self contained Spark application or can share state with other jobs using the SnappyData store. \n\n\nUnlike Apache Spark, which is primarily a computational engine, the SnappyData cluster holds mutable database state in its JVMs and requires all submitted Spark jobs/queries to share the same state (of course, with schema isolation and security as expected in a database). This required extending Spark in two fundamental ways.\n\n\n\n\nLong running executors\n: Executors are running within the SnappyData store JVMs and form a p2p cluster.  Unlike Spark, the application Job is decoupled from the executors - submission of a job does not trigger launching of new executors. \n\n\nDriver runs in HA configuration\n: Assignment of tasks to these executors are managed by the Spark Driver.  When a driver fails, this can result in the executors getting shutdown, taking down all cached state with it. Instead, we leverage the \nSpark JobServer\n to manage Jobs and queries within a \"lead\" node.  Multiple such leads can be started and provide HA (they automatically participate in the SnappyData cluster enabling HA). \nRead our \ndocs\n for details on the architecture.\n\n\n\n\nIn this document, we showcase mostly the same set of features via the Spark API or using SQL. If you are familiar with Scala and understand Spark concepts you may choose to skip the SQL part go directly to the Spark API section:\n\n\nGetting Started with Spark API\n.\n\n\nGetting Started with SQL\n\n\nFor SQL, the SnappyData SQL Shell (\nsnappy-shell\n) provides a simple way to inspect the catalog,  run admin operations,  manage the schema and run interactive queries. You can also use your favorite SQL tool like SquirrelSQL or DBVisualizer (a JDBC connection to the cluster).\n\n\nFrom the SnappyData base directory, /snappy/, run: \n\n\n./bin/snappy-shell\n\n\n\n\nConnect to the cluster with\n\n\nconnect client 'localhost:1527';\n\n\nYou can view connections with\n\n\nshow connections;\n\n\nAnd check member status with:\n\n\nshow members;\n\n\nColumn and Row tables (conceptual)\n\n\nColumn tables organize and manage data in memory in compressed columnar form such that modern day CPUs can traverse and run computations like a sum or an average really fast (as the values are available in contiguous memory). Column table follows the Spark DataSource access model.\n\n\n-- DDL to create a column table\nCREATE TABLE AIRLINE (\ncolumn definitions\n) USING column OPTIONS(buckets '5') ;\n\n\n\n\nRow tables, unlike column tables, are laid out one row at a time in contiguous memory. Rows are typically accessed using keys. A row's location is determined by a hash function and hence very fast for point lookups or updates.\n\n\ncreate table\n DDL for Row and Column tables allows tables to be partitioned on primary keys, custom partitioned, replicated, carry indexes in memory, persist to disk , overflow to disk, be replicated for HA, etc.  \n\n\n-- DDL to create a row table\nCREATE TABLE AIRLINEREF (\ncolumn definitions\n) USING row OPTIONS() ;\n\n\n\n\nRead our preliminary \nrow \n column table docs\n for the details.\n\n\nStep 2 - Create column table, row table and load data\n\n\n\n\nIf you downloaded the full airline data set in \nStep 1\n, edit the 'create_and_load_column_table.sql' script which is in \nquickstart/scripts\n to point to \nairlineParquetData_2007-15\n directory. Run \n./download_full_airlinedata.sh ../data\n first. This script loads parquet formatted data into a temporary spark table then saves it in column table called Airline.\n\n\n\n\nThe below SQL scripts create and populate the tables we need to continue. The displayed command assumes you started the snappy-shell the base directory, /snappy/. If you started the snappy-shell from /bin/, for example, you need to prepend the filepath with /..\n\n\nTo create and load a column table:\n\n\nrun './quickstart/scripts/create_and_load_column_table.sql';\n\n\n\n\nTo create and load a row table:\n\n\n run './quickstart/scripts/create_and_load_row_table.sql';\n\n\n\n\nTo see the status of the system:\n\n\nrun './quickstart/scripts/status_queries.sql'\n\n\n\n\nYou can see the memory consumed in the \nSpark Console\n. \n\n\nOLAP and OLTP queries (conceptual)\n\n\nSQL client connections (via JDBC or ODBC) are routed to the appropriate data server via the locator (Physical connections are automatically created in the driver and are transparently swizzled in case of failures also). When queries are executed they are parsed initially by the SnappyData server to determine if the query is an OLAP class or an OLTP class query.  Currently, all column table queries are considered OLAP.  Such queries are routed to the \nlead\n node where a \nSpark SQLContext\n is managed for each connection. The query is planned using Spark's Catalyst engine and scheduled to be executed on the data servers. The number of partitions determine the number of concurrent tasks used across the data servers to run the query in parallel. In this case, our column table was created using \n5 partitions (buckets)\n and hence will use 5 concurrent tasks. \n\n\n---- Which Airlines Arrive On Schedule? JOIN with reference table ----\nsnappy\n select AVG(ArrDelay) arrivalDelay, description AirlineName, UniqueCarrier carrier \n  from airline, airlineref\n  where airline.UniqueCarrier = airlineref.Code\n  group by UniqueCarrier, description \n  order by arrivalDelay;\n\n\n\n\nFor low latency OLTP queries, the engine won't route it to the lead and instead execute it immediately without any scheduling overhead. Quite often, this may mean simply fetching a row by hashing a key (in microseconds).\n\n\n--- Suppose a particular Airline company say 'Delta Air Lines Inc.' re-brands itself as 'Delta America'\n--- the airline code can be updated in the row table\nUPDATE AIRLINEREF SET DESCRIPTION='Delta America' WHERE CAST(CODE AS VARCHAR(25))='DL';\n\n\n\n\nSpark SQL can cache DataFrames as temporary tables and the data set is immutable. SnappyData SQL is compatible with the SQL standard with support for transactions and DML (insert, update, delete) on tables. \nLink to Snappy Store SQL reference\n.  As we show later, any table in SnappyData is also visible as a Spark DataFrame. \n\n\nStep 3 - Run OLAP and OLTP queries\n\n\nThe OLAP query we're executing is asking \"which airlines arrive on schedule?\" which requires a join to a reference table. You have the option to run the packaged query script or paste one query at a time. To run the script, in the snappy-shell paste:\n\n\nrun './quickstart/scripts/olap_queries.sql';\n\n\n\n\nTo paste the actual query, paste:\n\n\nselect AVG(ArrDelay) arrivalDelay, description AirlineName, UniqueCarrier carrier \n  from airline, airlineref\n  where airline.UniqueCarrier = airlineref.Code\n  group by UniqueCarrier, description \n  order by arrivalDelay;\n\n\n\n\nEach query is executed as one or more Jobs and each Job executed in one or more stages. You can explore the query execution plan and metrics \nthe Spark Console\n under \"SQL.\"\n\n\nThe OLTP query we're executing is updating \"Delta Airlines\" to \"Delta America.\" Paste the following command:\n\n\nrun './quickstart/scripts/oltp_queries.sql';\n\n\n\n\nYou can now re-run olap_queries.sql to see the updated join result set.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\nIn the current implementation we only support appending to Column tables. Future releases will support all DML operations. \nYou can execute transactions using commands \nautocommit off\n and \ncommit\n.  \n\n\n\n\nApproximate Query Processing (AQP) (conceptual)\n\n\nOLAP queries are expensive as they require traversing through large data sets and shuffling data across nodes. While the in-memory queries above executed in less than a second the response times typically would be much higher with very large data sets. On top of this, concurrent execution for multiple users would also slow things down. Achieving interactive query speed in most analytic environments requires drastic new approaches like AQP.\nSimilar to how indexes provide performance benefits in traditional databases, SnappyData provides APIs and DDL to specify one or more curated \nstratified samples\n on large tables. \n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWe recommend downloading the full dataset mentioned in \nStep 1\n which is about 52 million records. With the above data set (1 million rows) only about a third of the time is spent in query execution engine and  sampling is unlikely to show much of any difference in speed.\n\n\n\n\nThe following DDL creates a sample that is 3% of the full data set and stratified on 3 columns. The commonly used dimensions in your \nGroup by\n and \nWhere\n clauses make up the \nQuery Column Set\n (strata columns). Multiple samples can be created and queries that are executed on the base table are analyzed for appropriate sample selection. \n\n\nCREATE SAMPLE TABLE AIRLINE_SAMPLE\n   OPTIONS(\n    buckets '5',                          -- Number of partitions \n    qcs 'UniqueCarrier, Year_, Month_',   -- QueryColumnSet(qcs): The strata - 3% of each combination of Carrier, \n                                          -- Year and Month are stored as sample\n    fraction '0.03',                      -- How big should the sample be\n    strataReservoirSize '50',             -- Reservoir sampling to support streaming inserts\n    basetable 'Airline')                  -- The parent base table\n\n\n\n\nYou can run queries directly on the sample table (stored in columnar format) or on the base table. For base table queries you have to specify the \nWith Error\n constraint indicating to the SnappyData Query processor that a sample can be substituted for the full data set. \n\n\n-- What is the average arrival delay for all airlines for each month?;\nsnappy\n select avg(ArrDelay), Month_ from Airline where ArrDelay \n0 \n    group by Month_\n    with error .1 ;\n-- The above query will consult the sample and return an answer if the estimated answer \n-- is at least 90% accurate (here, by default we use a 95% confidence interval).\n\n-- You can also access the error using built-in functions. \nsnappy\n select avg(ArrDelay) avgDelay, absolute_error(avgDelay), Month_ \n    from Airline where ArrDelay \n0 \n    group by Month_\n    with error .1 ;\n\n\n\n\nStep 4 - Create, Load and Query Sample Table\n\n\nLike Step 3, we need to first create and load the sample table. The following script will sample the Airline table:\n\n\nrun './quickstart/scripts/create_and_load_sample_table.sql';\n\n\n\n\nYou can now re-run the previous OLAP queries with an error constraint and compare the results. The following script will run the previous queries with an error constraint:\n\n\nrun './quickstart/scripts/olap_approx_queries.sql';\n\n\n\n\nYou should notice a 10X or larger difference in query execution latency while the results remain nearly as accurate. As a reminder, we recommend downloading the larger data set for this exercise.\n\n\nStream analytics using SQL and Spark Streaming (conceptual)\n\n\nSnappyData extends Spark streaming so stream definitions can be declaratively written using SQL and you can analyze these streams using SQL. You can also dynamically run SQL queries on these streams. There is no need to learn Spark streaming APIs or statically define all the rules to be executed on these streams.\n\n\nThe commands below consume tweets, then they filter out just the hashtags and then they convert hashtags into Row objects. The commands then model the stream as a table (so it can be queried) and we then run ad-hoc SQL from remote clients on the current state of the stream. \n\n\n--- Inits the Streaming Context with the batch interval of 2 seconds.\n--- i.e. the stream is processed once every 2 seconds.\nsnappy\n STREAMING INIT 2;\n--- Create a stream table just containing the hashtags.\n--- /tmp/copiedtwitterdata is the directory that Streaming will use to find and read new text files.\n--- We use quickstart/scripts/simulateTwitterStream script in below example to simulate a twitter stream by\n--- copying tweets in /tmp/copiedtwitterdata folder.\nsnappy\n CREATE STREAM TABLE HASHTAG_FILESTREAMTABLE\n              (hashtag string)\n            USING file_stream\n            OPTIONS (storagelevel 'MEMORY_AND_DISK_SER_2',\n              rowConverter 'org.apache.spark.sql.streaming.TweetToHashtagRow',\n              directory '/tmp/copiedtwitterdata')\n--- A file_stream data source monitors the directory and as files arrives they are ingested\n--- into the streaming pipeline. First converted into Rows using 'TweetToHashtagRow' then visible as table\n--- Start streaming context \nsnappy\n STREAMING START\n--- Adhoc sql on the stream table to query the current batch\n--- Get top 10 popular hashtags ----\nsnappy\n SELECT hashtag, count(*) as tagcount\n        FROM HASHTAG_FILESTREAMTABLE\n        GROUP BY hashtag\n        ORDER BY tagcount DESC limit 10;\n\n\n\n\nLater, in the Spark API section we further enhance this concept to showcase \n\"continuous queries\" (CQ)\n. Dynamic registration of CQs (from remote clients) will be available in the next release.\n\n\nTop-K Elements in a Stream (conceptual)\n\n\nFinding the \nk\n most popular elements in a data stream is a common analytic query. For instance, the top-100 pages on a popular website in the last 10 mins, the top-10 sales regions in the last week, etc. As you can see, if the query is on an arbitrary time interval in the past, this will most likely mandate storing the entire stream. And, this could easily be millions to billions of events in use cases in the Internet of Things, for example. SnappyData provides SQL extensions to Spark to maintain top-k approximate structures on streams. Also, SnappyData adds a temporal component (i.e. data can be queried based on a time interval) to these structures and enables transparent querying using Spark SQL. More details about SnappyData's implementation of top-k can be found here:\n\n\nDetailed AQP Documentation\n\n\nSnappyData provides DDL extensions to create Top-k structures. And, if a stream table is specified as base table, the Top-k structure is automatically populated from it as data arrives. The Top-k structures can be queried using regular SQL queries. \n\n\n--- Create a topk table from a stream table\nCREATE TOPK TABLE filestream_topktable ON HASHTAG_FILESTREAMTABLE OPTIONS\n(key 'hashtag', timeInterval '2000ms', size '10' );\n--- Query a topk table \nSELECT hashtag, COUNT(hashtag) AS TopKCount\nFROM filestream_topktable\nGROUP BY hashtag ORDER BY TopKCount limit 10;\n\n\n\n\nNow, lets try analyzing some tweets using this above syntax in real time using SnappyData's packaged scripts.\n\n\nStep 5 - Create and Query Stream Table and Top-K Declaratively\n\n\nYou can use the scripts that simulates the twitter stream by copying pre-loaded tweets in a tmp folder. Or, you could use a script that accesses the live twitter stream.  \n\n\nSteps to work with simulated Twitter stream\n\n\nCreate a file stream table that listens on a folder and then start the streaming context. In the snappy-shell, paste:\n\n\nrun './quickstart/scripts/create_and_start_file_streaming.sql';\n\n\n\n\nRun the following utility in another terminal that simulates a twitter stream by copying tweets in the folder on which file stream table is listening.\n\n\n$ quickstart/scripts/simulateTwitterStream \n\n\n\n\nNow query the current batch of the stream using the following script. \n\n\n--- Run this command multiple times to query current batch at different times \nrun './quickstart/scripts/file_streaming_query.sql';\n--- Stop the streaming \nsnappy\n STREAMING STOP;\n\n\n\n\nThis also creates Topk structures. simulateTwitterStream script runs for only for a minute or so.\n\n\nSteps to work with live Twitter stream\n\n\nTo work with the live twitter stream, you will have to generate authorization keys and secrets on \ntwitter apps\n and update \nSNAPPY_HOME/quickstart/scripts/create_and_start_twitter_streaming.sql\n with the keys and secrets.\n\n\n--- Run the create and start script that has keys and secrets to fetch live twitter stream\n--- Note: Currently, we do not encrypt the keys. \n-- This also creates Topk structures\nsnappy\n run './quickstart/scripts/create_and_start_twitter_streaming.sql';\n\n\n\n\nNow query the current batch of the stream using the following script. \n\n\n--- Run this command multiple times to query current batch at different times \nsnappy\n run './quickstart/scripts/twitter_streaming_query.sql';\n--- Stop the streaming \nsnappy\n STREAMING STOP;\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started with Spark API\n\n\nSnappyContext is the main entry point for SnappyData extensions to Spark. A SnappyContext extends Spark's \nSQLContext\n to work with Row and Column tables. Any DataFrame can be managed as a SnappyData table and any table can be accessed as a DataFrame. This is similar to \nHiveContext\n and it integrates the SQLContext functionality with the SnappyData store. Similarly, SnappyStreamingContext is an entry point for SnappyData extensions to Spark Streaming and it extends Spark's \nStreaming Context\n. \n\n\nApplications typically submit Jobs to SnappyData and do not explicitly create a SnappyContext or SnappyStreamingContext. These jobs are the primary mechanism to interact with SnappyData using the Spark API. A job implements either SnappySQLJob or SnappyStreamingJob (for streaming applications) trait. \n\n\nclass SnappySampleJob implements SnappySQLJob {\n  /** Snappy uses this as an entry point to execute Snappy jobs. **/\n  def runJob(snc: SnappyContext, jobConfig: Config): Any\n\n  /** SnappyData calls this function to validate the job input and reject invalid job requests **/\n  def validate(sc: SnappyContext, config: Config): SparkJobValidation\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe implementation of the \nrunJob\n function from SnappySQLJob uses a SnappyContext to interact with the SnappyData store to process and store tables. The implementation of runJob from SnappyStreamingJob uses a SnappyStreamingContext to create streams and manage the streaming context. The jobs are submitted to the lead node of SnappyData over REST API using a \nspark-submit\n like utility. See more details about jobs here:\n\n\nSnappyData Jobs\n\n\nColumn and Row tables (conceptual)\n\n\nColumn tables organize and manage data in memory in compressed columnar form such that modern day CPUs can traverse and run computations like a sum or an average really fast (as the values are available in contiguous memory).

You can see the size of the column tables on Spark UI which by default can be seen at http://hostNameOfLead:4040. \n\n\nOLAP and OLTP Store (conceptual)\n\n\nSnappyContext extends SQLContext and adds functionality to work with row and column tables. When queries inside jobs are executed they are parsed initially by the SnappyData server to determine if it is an OLAP class or an OLTP class query.  Currently, all column table queries are considered OLAP. Such queries are planned using Spark's Catalyst engine and scheduled to be executed on the data servers. \n\n\nval resultDF = airlineDF.join(airlineCodeDF,\n        airlineDF.col(\nUniqueCarrier\n).equalTo(airlineCodeDF(\nCODE\n))).\n        groupBy(airlineDF(\nUniqueCarrier\n), airlineCodeDF(\nDESCRIPTION\n)).\n        agg(\nArrDelay\n -\n \navg\n).orderBy(\navg(ArrDelay)\n)\n\n\n\n\nFor low latency OLTP queries in jobs, SnappyData won't schedule these queries. Instead SnappyData executes them immediately on SnappyData servers without any scheduling overhead. Quite often, this may mean simply fetching or updating a row by hashing a key (in nanoseconds). \n\n\n// Suppose a particular Airline company say 'Delta Air Lines Inc.' re-brands itself as 'Delta America'. Update the row table.\nval filterExpr: String = \n CODE ='DL'\n\nval newColumnValues: Row = Row(\nDelta America\n)\nval updateColumns = \nDESCRIPTION\n\nsnappyContext.update(rowTableName, filterExpr, newColumnValues, updateColumns)\n\n\n\n\nStep 3 - Run OLAP and OLTP queries\n\n\nAirlineDataJob.scala\n runs OLAP and OLTP queries on SnappyData tables. Also, it caches the same airline data in the Spark cache and runs the same OLAP query on the Spark cache. With the airline data set, we have seen both the Spark cache and the SnappyData store to have more and less the same performance.  \n\n\n# Submit AirlineDataJob to SnappyData\n$ bin/snappy-job.sh submit --lead hostNameOfLead:8090 --app-name airlineApp  --class  io.snappydata.examples.AirlineDataJob --app-jar $SNAPPY_HOME/lib/quickstart-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\n{ \nstatus\n: \nSTARTED\n,\n  \nresult\n: {\n    \njobId\n: \n1b0d2e50-42da-4fdd-9ea2-69e29ab92de2\n,\n    \ncontext\n: \nsnappyContext1453196176725064822\n\n } }\n# A JSON with jobId of the submitted job is returned.

You can explore the Spark SQL query plan on Spark UI which by default can be seen at http://hostNameOfLead:4040.\n\n\nApproximate Query Processing (AQP) (conceptual)\n\n\nOLAP jobs are expensive as they require traversing through large data sets and shuffling data across nodes. While the in-memory jobs above executed in less than a second, the response times typically would be much higher with very large data sets. On top of this, concurrent execution for multiple users would also slow things down. Achieving interactive query speed in most analytic environments requires drastic new approaches like AQP.\nSimilar to how indexes provide performance benefits in traditional databases, SnappyData provides APIs to specify one or more curated \nstratified samples\n on large tables. \n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWe recommend downloading the full dataset mentioned in \nStep 1\n which is about 52 million records. With the above data set (1 million rows) only about a third of the time is spent in query execution engine and  sampling is unlikely to show much of any difference in speed.\n\n\n\n\nThe following scala code creates a sample that is 3% of the full data set and stratified on 3 columns. The commonly used dimensions in your \nGroup by\n and \nWhere\n clauses make up the \nQuery Column Set\n (strata columns). Multiple samples can be created and queries executed on the base table are analyzed for appropriate sample selection. \n\n\nval sampleDF = snappyContext.createTable(sampleTable, \n        \ncolumn_sample\n, // DataSource provider for sample tables\n        updatedSchema, Map(\nbuckets\n -\n \n5\n,\n          \nqcs\n -\n \nUniqueCarrier, Year_, Month_\n,\n          \nfraction\n -\n \n0.03\n,\n          \nstrataReservoirSize\n -\n \n50\n,\n          \nbasetable\n -\n \nAirline\n\n        ))\n\n\n\n\nYou can run queries directly on the sample table (stored in columnar format) or on the base table. For base table queries you have to specify the \nWith Error\n constraint indicating to the SnappyData Query processor that a sample can be substituted for the full data set. \n\n\n// Query Snappy Store's Sample table :Which Airlines arrive On schedule? JOIN with reference table\nsampleResult = sampleDF.join(airlineCodeDF,\n        sampleDF.col(\nUniqueCarrier\n).equalTo(airlineCodeDF(\nCODE\n))).\n          groupBy(sampleDF(\nUniqueCarrier\n), airlineCodeDF(\nDESCRIPTION\n)).\n          agg(\nArrDelay\n -\n \navg\n).orderBy(\navg(ArrDelay)\n)\n\n // Query Snappy Store's Airline table with error clause.\nairlineDF.groupBy(airlineDF(\nMonth_\n))\n  .agg(\nArrDelay\n -\n \navg\n)\n  .orderBy(\nMonth_\n).withError(0.05,0.95)\n\n\n\n\nStep 4 - Create, Load and Query Sample Table\n\n\nCreateAndLoadAirlineDataJob\n and \nAirlineDataJob\n executed in the previous sections created the sample tables and executed OLAP queries over them.\n\n\nStream analytics using Spark Streaming (conceptual)\n\n\nSnappyData extends Spark streaming so stream definitions can be declaratively written using SQL and streams can be analyzed using SQL. Also, SnappyData introduces \"continuous queries\" (CQ) on the stream. One can define a continous query as a SQL query on the stream with window and slide extensions which is returned as SchemaDStream i.e. DStream with schema. SnappyData's extensions provide functionality to insert a SchemaDStream into the SnappyData store. \n\n\nDynamic registration of CQs (from remote clients) will be available in the next release.\n\n\n// create a stream table declaratively \nsnsc.sql(\nCREATE STREAM TABLE RETWEETTABLE (retweetId long, \n +\n    \nretweetCnt int, retweetTxt string) USING file_stream \n +\n    \nOPTIONS (storagelevel 'MEMORY_AND_DISK_SER_2', \n +\n    \nrowConverter 'org.apache.spark.sql.streaming.TweetToRetweetRow',\n +\n    \ndirectory '/tmp/copiedtwitterdata')\n);\n\n// Register a continous query on the stream table with window and slide parameters\nval retweetStream: SchemaDStream = snsc.registerCQ(\nSELECT retweetId, retweetCnt FROM RETWEETTABLE \n +\n    \nwindow (duration '2' seconds, slide '2' seconds)\n)\n\n// Create a row table to hold the retweets based on their id \nsnsc.snappyContext.sql(s\nCREATE TABLE $tableName (retweetId bigint PRIMARY KEY, \n +\n    s\nretweetCnt int, retweetTxt string) USING row OPTIONS ()\n)\n\n// Iterate over the stream and insert it into snappy store\nretweetStream.foreachDataFrame(df =\n {\n    df.write.mode(SaveMode.Append).saveAsTable(tableName)\n})\n\n\n\n\nTop-K Elements in a Stream (conceptual)\n\n\nContinuously finding the \nk\n most popular elements in a data stream is a common analytic query. SnappyData provides extensions to Spark to maintain top-k approximate structures on streams. Also, SnappyData adds a temporal component (i.e. data can be queried based on a time interval) to these structures. More details about SnappyData's implementation of top-k can be found here:\n\n\nSnappyData's AQP Docs\n\n\nSnappyData provides an API in the SnappyContext to create a Top-k structure. And, if a stream table is specified as the base table, the Top-k structure is automatically populated from it as the data arrives. The Top-k structures can be queried using another API. \n\n\n--- Create a topk table from a stream table\nsnappyContext.createApproxTSTopK(\ntopktable\n, \nhashtag\n,\n    Some(schema), Map(\n      \nepoch\n -\n System.currentTimeMillis().toString,\n      \ntimeInterval\n -\n \n2000ms\n,\n      \nsize\n -\n \n10\n,\n      \nbasetable\n -\n \nHASHTAGTABLE\n\n    ))\n--- Query a topk table for the last two seconds\nval topKDF = snappyContext.queryApproxTSTopK(\ntopktable\n,\n                System.currentTimeMillis - 2000,\n                System.currentTimeMillis)\n\n\n\n\nStep 5 -  Create and Query Stream Table and Top-K\n\n\nIdeally, we would like you to try this example using live twitter stream. For that, you would have to generate authorization keys and secrets on twitter apps. Alternatively, you can use use file stream scripts that simulate the twitter stream by copying pre-loaded tweets in a tmp folder.\n\n\nSteps to work with simulated Twitter stream\n\n\nSubmit the \nTwitterPopularTagsJob\n that declares a stream table, creates and populates a topk-structure, registers a CQ on it and stores the result in the Snappy-store. It starts streaming and waits for two minutes. \n\n\n# Submit the TwitterPopularTagsJob \n$ ./bin/snappy-job.sh submit --lead hostNameOfLead:8090 --app-name TwitterPopularTagsJob --class io.snappydata.examples.TwitterPopularTagsJob --app-jar $SNAPPY_HOME/lib/quickstart-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --stream\n\n# Run the following utility in another terminal to simulate a twitter stream by copying tweets in the folder on which file stream table is listening.\n$ quickstart/scripts/simulateTwitterStream \n\n\n\n\n\nSteps to work with live Twitter stream\n\n\n# Set the keys and secrets to fetch the live twitter stream\n# Note: Currently, we do not encrypt the keys. \n$ export APP_PROPS=\nconsumerKey=\nconsumerKey\n,consumerSecret=\nconsumerSecret\n,accessToken=\naccessToken\n,accessTokenSecret=\naccessTokenSecret\n\n\n# submit the TwitterPopularTagsJob that declares a stream table, creates and populates a topk -structure, registers CQ on it and stores the result in a snappy store table \n# This job runs streaming for two minutes. \n$ /bin/snappy-job.sh submit --lead hostNameOfLead:8090 --app-name TwitterPopularTagsJob --class io.snappydata.examples.TwitterPopularTagsJob --app-jar $SNAPPY_HOME/lib/quickstart-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --stream\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output of the job can be found in \nTwitterPopularTagsJob_timestamp.out\n in the lead directory which by default is \nSNAPPY_HOME/work/localhost-lead-*/\n. \n\n\nWorking with Spark shell and spark-submit\n\n\nSnappyData, out-of-the-box, collocates Spark executors and the SnappyData store for efficient data intensive computations. But it may be desirable to isolate the computational cluster for other reasons, for instance, a  computationally intensive Map-reduce machine learning algorithm that needs to iterate over a cached data set repeatedly. To support such scenarios it is also possible to run native Spark jobs that access a SnappyData cluster as a storage layer in a parallel fashion. \n\n\n# Start the spark shell in local mode. Pass SnappyData's locators host:port as a conf parameter.\n# Change the UI port because the default port 4040 is being used by Snappy\u2019s lead. \n$ bin/spark-shell  --master local[*] --conf snappydata.store.locators=locatorhost:port --conf spark.ui.port=4041\nscala\n\nTry few commands on the spark-shell \n\n# fetch the tables and using sqlContext which is going to be an instance of SnappyContext in this case\nscala\n val airlinerefDF = sqlContext.table(\nairlineref\n).show\nscala\n val airlineDF = sqlContext.table(\nairline\n).show\n\n# you can now work with the dataframes to fetch the data.\n\n\n\n\nStep 6 - Submit a Spark App that interacts with SnappyData\n\n\n# Start the Spark standalone cluster.\n$ sbin/start-all.sh \n# Submit AirlineDataSparkApp to Spark Cluster with snappydata's locator host port.\n$ bin/spark-submit --class io.snappydata.examples.AirlineDataSparkApp --master spark://masterhost:7077 --conf snappydata.store.locators=locatorhost:port --conf spark.ui.port=4041 $SNAPPY_HOME/lib/quickstart-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\n\n# The results can be seen on the command line. \n\n\n\n\nFinal Step - Stop the SnappyData Cluster\n\n\n$ sbin/snappy-stop-all.sh \nlocalhost: The SnappyData Leader has stopped.\nlocalhost: The SnappyData Server has stopped.\nlocalhost: The SnappyData Locator has stopped.",

SQL based extensions for streaming processing : Use native Spark streaming, Dataframe APIs or declaratively specify your streams and how you want it processed. No need to learn Spark APIs to get going with stream processing or its subtleties when processing in parallel.  Interactive analytics using Approximate Query Processing (AQP) : We introduce multiple synopses techniques through data structures like count-min-sketch and stratified sampling to dramatically reduce in-memory space requirements and provide true interactive speeds for analytic queries. These structures can be created and managed by developers with little to no statistical background and are completely transparent to the SQL developer running queries. Error estimators are also integrated with simple mechanisms to get to the errors through built-in SQL functions.   Mutate, transact on data in Spark : Use SQL to insert, update, delete data in tables. We also provide extensions to Spark\u2019s context so you can mutate data in your spark programs. Any tables in SnappyData are visible as DataFrames without having to maintain multiples copies of your data.   Optimizations : Use indexes to improve query performance in the row store (the GemFire SQL optimizer automatically uses in-memory indexes when available)   High availability not just Fault tolerance : Data is instantly replicated (one at a time or batch at a time) to other nodes in the cluster and is deeply integrated with a membership based distributed system to detect and handle failures instantaneously providing applications with continuous HA.  Durability and recovery:  Data can also be managed on disk and automatically recovered. Utilities for backup and restore are bundled.

All the commands and programs\nlisted in the Spark guides will work in SnappyData also. For the section on SQL, no Spark knowledge is necessary.   To interact with SnappyData, we provide interfaces for developers familiar with Spark programming as well as SQL. JDBC can be used to connect to the SnappyData cluster and interact using SQL. On the other hand, users comfortable with the Spark programming paradigm can write jobs to interact with SnappyData. Jobs can be like a self contained Spark application or can share state with other jobs using the SnappyData store.   Unlike Apache Spark, which is primarily a computational engine, the SnappyData cluster holds mutable database state in its JVMs and requires all submitted Spark jobs/queries to share the same state (of course, with schema isolation and security as expected in a database). This required extending Spark in two fundamental ways.   Long running executors : Executors are running within the SnappyData store JVMs and form a p2p cluster.  Unlike Spark, the application Job is decoupled from the executors - submission of a job does not trigger launching of new executors.   Driver runs in HA configuration : Assignment of tasks to these executors are managed by the Spark Driver.  When a driver fails, this can result in the executors getting shutdown, taking down all cached state with it. Instead, we leverage the  Spark JobServer  to manage Jobs and queries within a \"lead\" node.  Multiple such leads can be started and provide HA (they automatically participate in the SnappyData cluster enabling HA). \nRead our  docs  for details on the architecture.   In this document, we showcase mostly the same set of features via the Spark API or using SQL.

Quickstart to compile\nproject:\n\n\n1. git clone git@github.com:SnappyDataInc/snappydata.git --recursive\n2. cd snappydata\n3. ./gradlew clean assemble\n\n\n\n\nRepository layout\n\n\nThere were few proposals about how to manage the various repositories mentioned in \nthis document\n. Based on few discussions, we shortlisted Proposal 4 in the document.\n\n\nAccording to \"Proposal 4\" gemxd and snappy-spark repositories will be independent of any other repository. There will be a third repository that will hold the code of Snappy - snappy-commons. Snappy-Commons will have two projects:\n\n\n(a) \nsnappy-core\n - Any code that is an extension to Spark code and is not dependent on gemxd, job server etc. should go in here. For e.g. SnappyContext, cluster manager etc.\n\n\n(b) \nsnappy-tools\n - This is the code that serves as the bridge between GemXD and snappy-spark.  For e.g. query routing, job server initialization etc.\n\n\nCode in snappy-tools can depend on snappy-core but it cannot happen other way round.\n\n\nThe snappy-spark repository has to be copied or moved inside snappy-commons for an integrated build.\n\n\n(c) \nsnappy-spark\n - This is the Spark code with Snappy modifcations.\n\n\nSimilarly the GemfireXD repository can be copied or moved inside snappy-commons by name \nsnappy-store\n for an integrated build with GemFireXD. The branch of GemFireXD to use is also \nsnappy-store\n that has been branched from rebrand_Dec13 recently for this purpose.\n\n\n(d) \nsnappy-store\n - This is the GemFireXD with Snappy additions.\n\n\n(e) \nsnappy-aqp\n - This is the Snappy Data proprietary code (AQP error estimation)\n\n\nNote that git operations have still to be done separately on snappy-commons, snappy-spark and snappy-store(GemFireXD) repositories.\n\n\nBuilding using gradle\n\n\nGradle builds have been arranged in a way so that all of snappy projects including snappy's spark variant can be built from the top-level. In addition snappy-spark and GemFireXD (inside snappy-store) can also be built separately. If the snappy-spark directory is not present inside snappy-commons, then it will try to use locally published snappy-spark artifacts instead. Likewise if there is no snappy-store directory, then it will use the local artifacts inside local-repo in snappy-commons:\n  * The full build and Intellij import has been tested with only JDK7. If you are using JDK8, then you are on your own (though it will likely work). On Ubuntu/Mint systems, best way to get Oracle JDK7 as default:\n\n\n- add webupd8 java repository: ````sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java````\n- install and set jdk7 as default: ````sudo aptitude install oracle-java7-set-default````\n- you can also install oracle-java7-unlimited-jce-policy package for enhanced JCE encryption\n- this will set java to point to JDK7 version and also set JAVA_HOME, \n- so start a new shell for the changes to take effect; \n- also run ````source /etc/profile.d/jdk.sh```` to update JAVA_HOME (or else you will \n- need to logoff and login again for the JAVA_HOME setting to get applied)\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure that snappy-spark repository has been moved/cloned inside snappy-commons by \"snappy-spark\" name. Similarly move the GemFireXD (snappy-store branch) repository inside snappy-commons by \"snappy-store\" name. The integrated build depends on its name and presence inside else it will use the local artifacts as mentioned before. \nDO NOT JUST SYMLINK THE DIRECTORIES\n -- that is known to cause trouble with IDE though command-line build may go through.\n\n\nUpdate both repos (snappy-commons and snappy-spark) to latest version and the GemFireXD repository in snappy-store to latest snappy-store branch. Then test the build with: \n./gradlew clean\n \n \n./gradlew assemble\n\n\nIf you see an error like \"Could not find hadoop-common-tests.jar\", then clear maven cache artifacts: \nrm -rf ~/.m2/repository/org/apache/hadoop\n, so that gradle can download all required depedencies, then run assemble target again.\n\n\nRun a snappy-core test application: \n./gradlew :snappy-core_2.10:run -PmainClass=io.snappydata.app.SparkSQLTest\n\n    AND/OR a GemFireXD junit test: \n./gradlew :snappy-store:gemfirexd:tools:test -Dtest.single=\\*\\*/BugsTest\n\n\n\n\nSetting up Intellij with gradle\n\n\nIf the build works fine, then import into Intellij:\n  * Update Intellij to the latest version, including the latest Scala plugin. Check using \nHelp-\nCheck for Update\n. The scala plugin version in \nFile-\nSettings-\nPlugins-\nScala\n should be at least 1.5.4 else update the plugin from that page.\n  * Double check that Scala plugin is enabled in \nFile-\nSettings-\nPlugins\n, as also the Gradle plugin. Note that update in previous step could have disabled either or both, so don't assume it would be enabled.\n  * Select import project, then point to the snappy-commons directory. Use external Gradle import. Add \n-XX:MaxPermSize=350m\n to VM options in global Gradle settings. Select defaults, next, next ... finish. Ignore \"Gradle location is unknown warning\". Ensure that a JDK7 installation has been selected.\n  * Disable the \"Unindexed remote maven repositories found\" warning message.\n  * Once import finishes, go to \nFile-\nSettings-\nEditor-\nCode Style-\nScala\n. Set the scheme as \nProject\n. Check that the same has been set in Java's Code Style too. Then OK to close it. Next copy \ncodeStyleSettings.xml\n in snappy-commons to .idea directory created by Intellij and then \nFile-\nSynchronize\n just to be sure. Check that settings are now applied in \nFile-\nSettings-\nEditor-\nCode Style-\nJava\n which should show TabSize, Indent as 2 and continuation indent as 4 (same for Scala).\n  * If the Gradle tab is not visible immediately, then select it from window list popup at the left-bottom corner of IDE. If you click on that window list icon, then the tabs will appear permanently.\n  * Generate avro and GemFireXD required sources by expanding: \nsnappy-commons_2.10-\nTasks-\nother\n. Right click on \ngenerateSources\n and run it. The Run item may not be available if indexing is still in progress, so wait for it to finish. The first run may take a while as it downloads jars etc. This step has to be done the first time, or if \n./gradlew clean\n has been run, or you have made changes to \njavacc/avro/messages.xml\n source files. \nIF YOU GET UNEXPECTED DATABASE NOT FOUND OR NPE ERRORS IN GemFireXD LAYER, THEN FIRST THING TO TRY IS TO RUN THE generateSources TARGET AGAIN.\n\n  * Increase the compiler heap sizes or else the build can take quite long especially with integrated GemFireXD. In \nFile-\nSettings-\nBuild, Execution, Deployment-\nCompiler increase\n, \nBuild process heap size\n to say 1536 or 2048. Similarly increase JVM maximum heap size in \nLanguages \n Frameworks-\nScala Compiler Server\n to 1536 or 2048.\n  * Test the full build.\n  * \nOpen Run-\nEdit Configurations\n. Expand Defaults, and select Application. Add \n-XX:MaxPermSize=350m\n in VM options. Similarly add it to VM parameters for ScalaTest and JUnit.\n  * For JUnit configuration also append \n/build-artifacts\n to the working directory i.e. the directory should be \n$MODULE_DIR$/build-artifacts\n. Likewise change working directory for ScalaTest to be inside build-artifacts otherwise all intermediate log and other files (especially created by GemFireXD) will pollute the source tree and may need to cleaned manually.\n  * Try \nRun-\nRun\n... on a test like SparkSQLTest.\n\n\nRunning a junit/scalatest\n\n\nRunning an application like SparkSQLTest should be straightforward -- just ensure that MaxPermSize has been increased as mentioned above especially for Spark/Snappy tests. For running junit/scalatest:\n\n\n\n\nWhen selecting a run configuration for junit/scalatest, avoid selecting the gradle one (green round icon) otherwise that will launch an external gradle process that will start building the project all over again. Use the normal junit (red+green arrows icon) or scalatest (junit like with red overlay).\n\n\nFor JUnit tests, ensure that working directory is \n$MODULE_DIR$/build-artifacts\n as mentioned before. Otherwise many GemFireXD tests will fail to find the resource files required in many tests. They will also pollute the checkouts with large number of log files etc, so this will allow those to go into build-artifacts that can also be cleaned up easily.\n\n\n\n\nManual sources and docs imports\n\n\nIf sources and docs were selected during initial import, then it can take a long time to get sources+docs for all dependencies. Instead one way could be to get the sources+docs for only scala-lang jars. The project setup after import already links sources and javadocs to appropriate locations in .m2 local cache, but since sources+docs were not selected during import so Maven may not have downloaded them yet. Check if you already have sources in m2 cache by opening a scala-lang class like Seq (hit \nShift-\nCtrl-\nT\n when using eclipse bindings and type scala.collection.Seq) and check if sources+docs are correctly shown. If not, then to easily download for selected jars do this:\n  * Open the \nFile-\nProject Structure-\nLibraries\n\n  * Click on the \n+\n sign at the top to add new library, and choose Maven.\n  * In the box, provide \nscala-library-2.10.4\n and click on the search tool.\n  * Select the \norg.scala-lang:scala-library:2.10.4\n in the drop down. Then check \"Sources\", \"JavaDocs\" options and go ahead.\n  * Do the same for others like \nscala-reflect-2.10.4\n and \nscala-compiler-2.10.4\n as required.\n  * Once this is done, don't select OK on the main Project Structure box. Instead hit \"Cancel\" and it should be all good since we only wanted to get Maven to download the sources and docs for these jars.\n\n\nGit configuration to use keyring/keychain\n\n\nSnappy is currently hosting private repositories and will continue to do\nso for foreseable future. One way to avoid passing credentials everytime could\nhave been to upload the public SSH key and use git:// URL. However, that doesn't\nwork at least in Pune network due to firewall issue (and proxy server not\nsupporting proxying ssh). However, it is possible to configure git to enable\nusing gnome-keyring on Linux platforms, and KeyChain on OSX to avoid it.\n(sumedh: latter not verified by me yet, so someone who uses OSX should do it)\n\n\nOn Linux Ubuntu/Mint:\n\n\nInstall gnome-keyring dev files: sudo aptitude install libgnome-keyring-dev\n\n\nBuild git-credential-gnome-keyring:\n\n\ncd build/git-gnome-keyring\nmake\n\n\n\nCopy to PATH (optional):\n\n\nsudo cp git-credential-gnome-keyring /usr/local/bin\nmake clean\n\n\n\nNote that if you skip this step then need to give full path in the next\nstep i.e. /path-to-snappy-commons/build/git-gnome-keyring/git-credential-gnome-keyring\n\n\nConfigure git: git config --global credential.helper gnome-keyring\n\n\nSimilarly on OSX locate git-credential-osxkeychain, build it if not present\n(it is named \"osxkeychain\" instead of gnome-keyring), then set in git config.\n\n\nNow your git password will be stored in keyring/keychain which is normally\nunlocked automatically on login (or you will be asked to unlock on first use).\n\n\nOn Linux, you can install \"seahorse\", if not already, to see/modify all\nthe passwords in keyring (GUI menu \"Passwords and Keys\" under Preferences\nor Accessories or System Tools)",

No need to learn Spark APIs to get going with stream processing or its subtleties when processing in parallel.\n\n\nInteractive analytics using Approximate query processing(AQP)\n: We introduce multiple synopses techniques through data structures like count-min-sketch and stratified sampling to dramatically reduce the in-memory space requirements and provide true interactive speeds for analytic queries. These structures can be created and managed by developers with little to no statistical background and can be completely transparent to the SQL developer running queries. Error estimators are also integrated with simple mechanisms to get to the errors through built-in SQL functions. \n\n\nMutate, transact on data in Spark\n: You can use SQL to insert, update, delete data in tables as one would expect. We also provide extensions to Spark\u2019s context so you can mutate data in your spark programs. Any tables in SnappyData is visible as DataFrames without having to maintain multiples copies of your data: cached RDDs in Spark and then separately in your data store. \n\n\nOptimizations - Indexing\n: You can index your row store and the GemFire SQL optimizer will automatically use in-memory indexes when available. \n\n\nOptimizations - colocation\n: SnappyData implements several optimizations to improve data locality and avoid shuffling data for queries on partitioned data sets. All related data can be collocated using declarative custom partitioning strategies(e.g. common shared business key). Reference data tables can be modeled as replicated tables when tables cannot share a common key. Replicas are always consistent. \n\n\nHigh availability not just Fault tolerance\n: Data can be instantly replicated (one at a time or batch at a time) to other nodes in the cluster and is deeply integrated with a membership based distributed system to detect and handle failures instantaneously providing applications continuous HA.\n\n\nDurability and recovery:\n Data can also be managed on disk and automatically recovered. Utilities for backup and restore are bundled. \n\n\n\n\nSpark challenges for mixed workloads (OLTP, OLAP)\n\n\nSpark is designed as a computational engine for processing batch jobs. Each Spark application (e.g., a Map-reduce job) runs as an independent set of processes (i.e., executor JVMs) on the cluster. These JVMs are re- used for the lifetime of the application. While, data can be cached and reused in these JVMs for a single application, sharing data across applications or clients requires an ex- ternal storage tier, such as HDFS. We, on the other hand, target a real-time, \u201calways-on\u201d, operational design center\u2014 clients can connect at will, and share data across any number of concurrent connections. This is similar to any operational database on the market today. Thus, to manage data in the same JVM, our first challenge is to alter the life cycle of these executors so that they are long-lived and de-coupled from individual applications.\n\n\nA second but related challenge is Spark\u2019s design for how user requests (i.e., jobs) are handled. A single driver orchestrates all the work done on the executors. Given our need for high concurrency and a hybrid OLTP-OLAP workload, this driver introduces\n\n\n\n\na single point of contention for all requests, and \n\n\na barrier for achieving high availability (HA). Executors are shutdown if the driver fails, requiring a full refresh of any cached state.\n\n\n\n\nSpark\u2019s primary usage of memory is for caching RDDs and for shuffling blocks to other nodes. Data is managed in blocks and is immutable. On the other hand, we need to manage more complex data structures (along with indexes) for point access and updates. Therefore, another challenge is merging these two disparate storage systems with little impedance to the application. This challenge is exacerbated by current limitations of Spark SQL\u2014mostly related to mu- tability characteristics and conformance to SQL.\n\n\nFinally, Spark\u2019s strong and growing community has zero tolerance for incompatible forks.

            "text": "Architecture overview\n\n\nThis section presents a high level overview of SnappyData\u2019s core components, as well as our data pipeline as streams are ingested into our in-memory store and subsequently interacted with and analyzed.\n\n\nCore components\n\n\nFigure 1 depicts the core components of SnappyData, where Spark\u2019s original components are highlighted in gray. To simplify, we have omitted standard components, such as security and monitoring.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe storage layer is primarily in-memory and manages data in either row or column formats. The column format is derived from Spark\u2019s RDD caching implementation and allows for compression. Row oriented tables can be indexed on keys or secondary columns, supporting fast reads and writes on index keys. See \nRow/Column table\n section for details on the syntax and available features. \n\n\nWe support two primary programming models \u2014 SQL and Spark\u2019s API. SQL access is through JDBC/ODBC and is supports the Spark SQL dialect with several extensions to make the language compatible to the SQL standard. One could perceive SnappyData as a SQL database that uses Spark API as its language for stored procedures.Our \nstream processing\n is primarily through Spark Streaming, but it is integrated and runs in-situ with our store .\n\n\nThe OLAP scheduler and job server coordinate all OLAP and Spark jobs and are capable of working with external cluster managers, such as YARN or Mesos(not yet supported). We route all OLTP operations immediately to appropriate data partitions without incurring any scheduling overhead.\n\n\nTo support replica consistency, fast point updates, and instantaneous detection of failure conditions in the cluster, we use a P2P (peer-to-peer) cluster membership service that en- sures view consistency and virtual synchrony in the cluster. Any of the in-memory tables can be synchronously replicated using this P2P cluster.\n\n\nIn addition to the \u201cexact\u201d dataset, data can also be summarized using probabilistic data structures, such as stratified samples and other forms of synopses. Using our API, applications can choose to trade accuracy for performance. SnappyData\u2019s query engine has built-in support for approximate query processing (AQP) and will exploit appropriate probabilistic data structures to meet the user\u2019s requested level of accuracy or performance.\n\n\nTo understand the data flow architecture, we first walk through a real time use case that involves stream processing, ingesting into a in-memory store and interactive analytics. \n\n\nUse case\n\n\nLocation based services from telco network providers\n\n\nThe global proliferation of mobile devices has created a growing market for location based services. In addition to locality-aware search and navigation, network providers are increasingly relying on location-based advertising, emergency call positioning, road traffic optimization, efficient call routing, triggering preemptive maintenance of cell towers, roaming analytics, and tracking vulnerable people in real time. Telemetry events are delivered as Call Detail Records (CDR), containing hundreds of attributes about each call. Ingested CDRs are cleansed and transformed for consumption by various applications. Not being able to correlate customer support calls with location specific network congestion information is a problem that frustrates customers and network technicians alike. The ability to do this in real time may involve expensive joins to history, tower traffic data and subscriber profiles. Incoming streams generate hundreds of aggregate metrics and KPIs (key performance indicators) grouped by subscriber, cell phone type, cell tower, and location. This requires continuous updates to counters accessed through primary keys (such as the subscriberID). While the generated data is massive, it still needs to be interactively queried by a data analyst for network performance analysis. Location-based services represent another common problem among our customers that involves high concurrency, continuous data updates, complex queries, time series data, and a source that cannot be throttled.\n\n\nData ingestion pipeline\n\n\nThe data pipeline involving analytics while streams are being ingested and subsequent interactive analytics will be the pervasive archicture for real-time applications. The steps to support these tasks are depicted in Figure 2, and explained below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the SnappyData cluster is started and before any live streams can be processed, we can ensure that the historical and reference datasets are readily accessible. The data sets may come from HDFS, enterprise relational databases (RDB), or disks managed by SnappyData. Immutable batch sources (e.g., HDFS) can be loaded in parallel into a colum- nar format table with or without compression. Reference data that is often mutating can be managed as row tables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe rely on Spark Streaming\u2019s parallel receivers to consume data from multiple sources. These receivers produce a DStream, whereby the input is batched over small time intervals and emitted as a stream of RDDs. This batched data is typically transformed, enriched and emit- ted as one or more additional streams. The raw incoming stream may be persisted into HDFS for batch analytics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we use SQL to analyze these streams. As DStreams (RDDs) use the same processing and data model as data stored in tables (DataFrames), we can seamlessly combine these data structures in arbitrary SQL queries (referred to as continuous queries as they execute each time the stream emits a batch). When faced with complex analytics or high velocity streams, SnappyData can still provide answers in real time by resorting to approximation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stream processing layer can interact with the storage layer in a variety of ways. The enriched stream can be efficiently stored in a column table. The results of continuous queries may result in several point updates in the store (e.g., maintaining counters). The continuous queries may join, correlate, and aggregate with other streams, history or reference data tables. When records are written into column tables one (or a small batch) at a time, data goes through stages, arriving first into a delta row buffer that is capable of high write rates, and then aging into a columnar form. Our query sub-system (which extends Spark\u2019s Catalyst optimizer) merges the delta row buffer during query execution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo prevent running out of memory, tables can be configured to evict or overflow to disk using an LRU strategy. For instance, an application may ingest all data into HDFS while preserving the last day\u2019s worth of data in memory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce ingested, the data is readily available for interactive analytics using SQL. Similar to stream analytics, SnappyData can again use approximate query processing to ensure interactive analytics on massive historical data in accordance to users\u2019 requested accuracy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHybrid Cluster Manager\n\n\nAs shown in Figure above, spark applications run as independent processes in the cluster, coordinated by the application\u2019s main program, called the driver program. Spark applications connect to cluster managers (e.g., YARN and Mesos) to acquire executors on nodes in the cluster. Executors are processes that run computations and store data for the running application. The driver program owns a sin- gleton (SparkContext) object which it uses to communicate with its set of executors.\n\n\nWhile Spark\u2019s approach is appropriate and geared towards compute-heavy tasks that scan large datasets, SnappyData must meet additional requirements (1\u20134) as an operational database.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh concurrency\n : SnappyData use cases involve a mixture of compute-intensive workloads and low latency (sub-millisecond) OLTP operations such as point lookups (index-based search), and insert/update of a single record. The fair scheduler of Spark is not designed to meet the low latency requirements of such operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState sharing\n : Each application submitted to Spark works in isolation. State sharing across applications requires an external store, which increases latency and is not viable for near real time data sharing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh availability (HA) \u2014 As a highly concurrent distributed system that offers low latency access to data, we must protect applications from node failures (caused by soft- ware bugs and hardware/network failures). High availability of data and transparent handling of failed operations there- fore become an important requirement for SnappyData.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsistency \u2014 As a highly available system that of- fers concurrent data access, it becomes important to ensure that all applications have a consistent view of data.\nAfter an overview of our cluster architecture in section 5.1, we explain how SnappyData meets each of these require- ments in the subsequent sections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnappyData Cluster Architecture\n\n\nA SnappyData cluster is a peer-to-peer (P2P) network comprised of three distinct types of members (see figure 4).\n1. Locator. Locator members provide discovery service for the cluster. They inform a new member joining the group about other existing members. A cluster usually has more than one locator for high availability reasons.\n2. Lead Node. The lead node member acts as a Spark driver by maintaining a singleton SparkContext. There is one primary lead node at any given instance but there can be multiple secondary lead node instances on standby for fault tolerance. The lead node hosts a REST server to accept and run applications. The lead node also executes SQL queries routed to it by \u201cdata server\u201d members.\n3. Data Servers. A data server member hosts data, em- beds a Spark executor, and also contains a SQL engine ca- pable of executing certain queries independently and more efficiently than Spark. Data servers use intelligent query routing to either execute the query directly on the node, or pass it to the lead node for execution by Spark SQL.\n\n\nHigh Concurrency in SnappyData\n\n\nThousands of concurrent ODBC and JDBC clients can si- multaneously connect to a SnappyData cluster. To support this degree of concurrency, SnappyData categorizes incom- ing requests from these clients into (i) low latency requests and (ii) high latency ones. For low latency operations, we completely bypass Spark\u2019s scheduling mechanism and di- rectly operate on the data. We route high latency opera- tions (e.g., compute intensive queries) through Spark\u2019s fair scheduling mechanism. This makes SnappyData a respon- sive system, capable of handling multiple low latency short operations as well as complex queries that iterate over large datasets simultaneously.\n\n\nState Sharing in SnappyData\n\n\nA SnappyData cluster is designed to be a long running clustered database. State is managed in tables that can be shared across any number of connecting applications. Data is stored in memory and replicated to at least one other node in the system. Data can be persisted to disk in shared nothing disk files for quick recovery. (See section 4 for more details on table types and redundancy.) Nodes in the cluster stay up for a long time and their life-cycle is independent of application lifetimes. SnappyData achieves this goal by decoupling its process startup and shutdown mechanisms from those used by Spark.",

To simplify, we have omitted standard components, such as security and monitoring.   The storage layer is primarily in-memory and manages data in either row or column formats. The column format is derived from Spark\u2019s RDD caching implementation and allows for compression. Row oriented tables can be indexed on keys or secondary columns, supporting fast reads and writes on index keys. See  Row/Column table  section for details on the syntax and available features.   We support two primary programming models \u2014 SQL and Spark\u2019s API. SQL access is through JDBC/ODBC and is supports the Spark SQL dialect with several extensions to make the language compatible to the SQL standard. One could perceive SnappyData as a SQL database that uses Spark API as its language for stored procedures.Our  stream processing  is primarily through Spark Streaming, but it is integrated and runs in-situ with our store .  The OLAP scheduler and job server coordinate all OLAP and Spark jobs and are capable of working with external cluster managers, such as YARN or Mesos(not yet supported). We route all OLTP operations immediately to appropriate data partitions without incurring any scheduling overhead.  To support replica consistency, fast point updates, and instantaneous detection of failure conditions in the cluster, we use a P2P (peer-to-peer) cluster membership service that en- sures view consistency and virtual synchrony in the cluster. Any of the in-memory tables can be synchronously replicated using this P2P cluster.  In addition to the \u201cexact\u201d dataset, data can also be summarized using probabilistic data structures, such as stratified samples and other forms of synopses. Using our API, applications can choose to trade accuracy for performance. SnappyData\u2019s query engine has built-in support for approximate query processing (AQP) and will exploit appropriate probabilistic data structures to meet the user\u2019s requested level of accuracy or performance.  To understand the data flow architecture, we first walk through a real time use case that involves stream processing, ingesting into a in-memory store and interactive analytics.",

In addition to locality-aware search and navigation, network providers are increasingly relying on location-based advertising, emergency call positioning, road traffic optimization, efficient call routing, triggering preemptive maintenance of cell towers, roaming analytics, and tracking vulnerable people in real time. Telemetry events are delivered as Call Detail Records (CDR), containing hundreds of attributes about each call. Ingested CDRs are cleansed and transformed for consumption by various applications. Not being able to correlate customer support calls with location specific network congestion information is a problem that frustrates customers and network technicians alike. The ability to do this in real time may involve expensive joins to history, tower traffic data and subscriber profiles. Incoming streams generate hundreds of aggregate metrics and KPIs (key performance indicators) grouped by subscriber, cell phone type, cell tower, and location. This requires continuous updates to counters accessed through primary keys (such as the subscriberID). While the generated data is massive, it still needs to be interactively queried by a data analyst for network performance analysis. Location-based services represent another common problem among our customers that involves high concurrency, continuous data updates, complex queries, time series data, and a source that cannot be throttled.",

The steps to support these tasks are depicted in Figure 2, and explained below.     Once the SnappyData cluster is started and before any live streams can be processed, we can ensure that the historical and reference datasets are readily accessible. The data sets may come from HDFS, enterprise relational databases (RDB), or disks managed by SnappyData. Immutable batch sources (e.g., HDFS) can be loaded in parallel into a colum- nar format table with or without compression. Reference data that is often mutating can be managed as row tables.    We rely on Spark Streaming\u2019s parallel receivers to consume data from multiple sources. These receivers produce a DStream, whereby the input is batched over small time intervals and emitted as a stream of RDDs. This batched data is typically transformed, enriched and emit- ted as one or more additional streams. The raw incoming stream may be persisted into HDFS for batch analytics.    Next, we use SQL to analyze these streams. As DStreams (RDDs) use the same processing and data model as data stored in tables (DataFrames), we can seamlessly combine these data structures in arbitrary SQL queries (referred to as continuous queries as they execute each time the stream emits a batch). When faced with complex analytics or high velocity streams, SnappyData can still provide answers in real time by resorting to approximation.    The stream processing layer can interact with the storage layer in a variety of ways. The enriched stream can be efficiently stored in a column table. The results of continuous queries may result in several point updates in the store (e.g., maintaining counters). The continuous queries may join, correlate, and aggregate with other streams, history or reference data tables. When records are written into column tables one (or a small batch) at a time, data goes through stages, arriving first into a delta row buffer that is capable of high write rates, and then aging into a columnar form.

Lead node embeds a Spark driver and Server node embeds a Spark Executor. Server node also embeds a snappy store. As discussed in \nGetting Started\n, SnappyData cluster can be started with default configurations using script sbin/snappy-start-all.sh. This script starts up a locator, one data server and one lead node. However, SnappyData can be configured to start multiple components on different nodes. Also, each component can be configured individually using configuration files. In this document, we discuss how the components can be individually configured. We also discuss various other configurations of SnappyData. \n\n\nConfiguration files\n\n\nConfiguration files for locator, lead and server should be created in SNAPPY_HOME with names as conf/locators, conf/leads and conf/servers respectively. These files contain the hostnames of the nodes (one per line) where you intend to start the member. You can specify the properties to configure individual members. \n\n\nSnappyData specific properties\n\n\nThe following are the few important SnappyData properties that you would like to configure. \n\n\n\n\n-peer-discovery-port\n: This is a locator specific property. This is the port on which locator listens for member discovery. It defaults to 10334. \n\n\n-client-port\n: Port that a member listens on for client connections. \n\n\n-locators\n: List of other locators as comma-separated host:port values. For locators, the list must include all other locators in use. For Servers and Leads, the list must include all the locators of the distributed system.\n\n\n-dir\n: SnappyData members need to have working directory. The member working directory provides a default location for log, persistence, and status files for each member. If not specified, SnappyData creates the member directory in \nSNAPPY_HOME\\work\n. \n\n\n-classpath\n: This can be used to provide any application specific code to the lead and servers. We envisage having setJar like functionality going forward but for now, the application jars have to be provided during startup. \n\n\n-heap-size\n: Set a fixed heap size and for the Java VM. \n\n\n-J\n: Use this to configure any JVM specific property. For e.g. -J-XX:MaxPermSize=512m. \n\n\n\n\nFor a detail list of SnappyData configurations for Leads and Servers, you can consult \nthis\n. For a detail list of SnappyData configurations for Locators, you can consult \nthis\n.\n\n\nSpark specific properties\n\n\nSince SnappyData embeds Spark components, \nSpark Runtime environment properties\n (like  spark.driver.memory, spark.executor.memory, spark.driver.extraJavaOptions, spark.executorEnv) do not take effect. They have to be specified using SnappyData configuration properties. Apart from these properties, other Spark properties can be specified in the configuration file of the Lead nodes. You have to prepend them with a \nhyphen(-)\n. The Spark properties that are specified on the Lead node are sent to the Server nodes. Any Spark property that is specified in the conf/servers or conf/locators file is ignored. \n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\n\nCurrently we do not honour properties specified using spark-config.sh. \n\n\n\n\nExample Configuration\n\n\nLet's say you want to start two Locators (on node-a:9999 and node-b:8888), two servers (node-c and node-c) and a lead (node-l). Also, you would like to change the Spark UI port from 4040 to 9090. Also, you would like to set spark.executor.cores as 10 on all servers. The following can be your conf files. \n\n\n$ cat conf/locators\nnode-a -peer-discovery-port=9999 -dir=/node-a/locator1 -heap-size=1024m -locators=node-b:8888\nnode-b -peer-discovery-port=8888 -dir=/node-b/locator2 -heap-size=1024m -locators=node-a:9999\n\n$ cat conf/servers\nnode-c -dir=/node-c/server1 -heap-size=4096m -locators=node-b:8888,node-a:9999\nnode-c -dir=/node-c/server2 -heap-size=4096m -locators=node-b:8888,node-a:9999\n\n$ cat conf/leads\n# This goes to the default directory \nnode-l -heap-size=4096m -J-XX:MaxPermSize=512m -spark.ui.port=9090 -locators=node-b:8888,node-a:9999 -spark.executor.cores=10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\n\nconf files are consulted when servers are started and also when they are stopped. So, we do not recommend changing the conf files while the cluster is running. \n\n\n\n\nEnvironment settings\n\n\nAny Spark or SnappyData specific environment settings can be done by creating a snappy-env.sh or spark-env.sh in \nSNAPPY_HOME/conf\n. \n\n\nPer Component Configuration\n\n\nMost of the time, components would be sharing the same properties. For e.g. you would want all servers to start with 4096m while leads to start with 2048m. You can configure these by specifying LOCATOR_STARTUP_OPTIONS, SERVER_STARTUP_OPTIONS, LEAD_STARTUP_OPTIONS environment variables in conf/snappy-env.sh. \n\n\n$ cat conf/snappy-env.sh\nSERVER_STARTUP_OPTIONS=\n-heap-size=4096m\n\nLEAD_STARTUP_OPTIONS=\n-heap-size=2048m\n\n\n\n\n\nsnappy-shell Command Line Utility\n\n\nInstead of starting SnappyData members using ssh scripts, they can be individually configured and started using command line. \n\n\n$ bin/snappy-shell locator start  -dir=/node-a/locator1 \n$ bin/snappy-shell server start  -dir=/node-b/server1  -locators:localhost:10334\n\n$ bin/snappy-shell locator stop\n$ bin/snappy-shell server stop\n\n\n\n\nLogging\n\n\nCurrently, log files for SnappyData components go inside the working directory. To change the log file directory, you can specify a property \n-log-file\n as the path of the directory. There is a log4j.properties file that is shipped with the jar. We recommend not to change it at this moment. However, to change the logging levels, you can create a conf/log4j.properties with the following details: \n\n\n$ cat conf/log4j.properties \nlog4j.rootCategory=DEBUG, file",

You can create Object based RDDs and run transformations or use the higher level APIs(like Spark ML). All SnappyData managed tables are also accessible as DataFrame and the API extends Spark classes like SQLContext and DataFrames.  So, we recommend getting to know the \nconcepts in SparkSQL\n and the \nDataFrame API\n. And, you can store and manage arbitrary RDDs (or even Spark DataSets) through implicit or explicit transformation to a DataFrame. While, the complete SQL support is still evolving, the supported SQL is much richer than SparkSQL. The extension SQL supported by the SnappyStore can be referenced \nhere\n.\n\n\nIn Spark SQL, all tables are temporary and cannot be shared across different applications. While you can manage such temporary tables, SnappyData tables are automatically registered to a built-in persistent catalog. This is similar to how Spark SQL uses the Hive catalog to natively work with Hive clusters. Data in tables is primarily managed in-memory with one or more consistent copies across machines or racks, but, can also be reliably managed on disk. \n\n\nSnappyContext\n\n\nA SnappyContext is the main entry point for SnappyData extensions to Spark. A SnappyContext extends Spark's \nSQLContext\n to work with Row and Column tables. Any DataFrame can be managed as SnappyData tables and any table can be accessed as a DataFrame. This is similar to \nHiveContext\n - integrates the SQLContext functionality with the Snappy store.\n\n\nUsing SnappyContext to create table and query data\n\n\nHere is an example to create a SnappyContext from SparkContext. \n\n\n  val conf = new org.apache.spark.SparkConf()\n               .setAppName(\nExampleTest\n)\n               .setMaster(\nlocal[*]\n)\n\n  val sc = new org.apache.spark.SparkContext(conf)\n  // get the SnappyContext\n  val snc: SnappyContext = org.apache.spark.sql.SnappyContext.getOrCreate(sc)\n\n\n\n\nCreate columnar tables using API. Other than \ncreate\n, \ndrop\n table rest is all based on the Spark SQL Data Source APIs. \n\n\n  val props1 = Map(\nBUCKETS\n -\n \n2\n)  // Number of partitions to use in the SnappyStore\n  case class Data(COL1: Int, COL2: Int, COL3: Int)\n  val data = Seq(Seq(1, 2, 3), Seq(7, 8, 9), Seq(9, 2, 3), Seq(4, 2, 3), Seq(5, 6, 7))\n  val rdd = sc.parallelize(data, data.length).map(s =\n new Data(s(0), s(1), s(2)))\n\n  val dataDF = snc.createDataFrame(rdd)\n\n  // create a column table\n  snc.dropTable(\nCOLUMN_TABLE\n, ifExists = true)\n\n  // \ncolumn\n is the table format (that is row or column)\n  // dataDF.schema provides the schema for table\n  snc.createTable(\nCOLUMN_TABLE\n, \ncolumn\n, dataDF.schema, props1)\n  // insert the data in append mode\n  dataDF.write.format(\ncolumn\n).mode(org.apache.spark.sql.SaveMode.Append)\n  .options(props1).saveAsTable(\nCOLUMN_TABLE\n)\n\n  val results1 = snc.sql(\nSELECT * FROM COLUMN_TABLE\n)\n  println(\ncontents of column table are:\n)\n  results1.foreach(println)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe optional BUCKETS attribute specifies the number of partitions or buckets to use. In SnappyStore, when data migrates between nodes (say if the cluster was expanded) a bucket is the smallest unit that can be moved around. For more detailes about the properties ('props1' map in above example) and createTable API refer to documentation for \nrow and column tables\n\n\nCreate row tables using API, update the contents of row table\n\n\n  // create a row format table called ROW_TABLE\n  snc.dropTable(\nROW_TABLE\n, ifExists = true)\n  // \nrow\n is the table format \n  // dataDF.schema provides the schema for table\n  val props2 = Map.empty[String, String]\n  snc.createTable(\nROW_TABLE\n, \nrow\n, dataDF.schema, props2)\n\n  // insert the data in append mode\n  dataDF.write.format(\nrow\n).mode(org.apache.spark.sql.SaveMode.Append)\n  .options(props2).saveAsTable(\nROW_TABLE\n)\n\n  val results2 = snc.sql(\nselect * from ROW_TABLE\n)\n  println(\ncontents of row table are:\n)\n  results2.foreach(println)\n\n  // row tables can be mutated\n  // for example update \nROW_TABLE\n and set col3 to 99 where\n  // criteria \ncol3 = 3\n is true using update API\n  snc.update(\nROW_TABLE\n, \nCOL3 = 3\n, org.apache.spark.sql.Row(99), \nCOL3\n )\n\n  val results3 = snc.sql(\nSELECT * FROM ROW_TABLE\n)\n  println(\ncontents of row table are after setting col3 = 99 are:\n)\n  results3.foreach(println)\n\n  // update rows using sql update statement\n  snc.sql(\nUPDATE ROW_TABLE SET COL1 = 100 WHERE COL3 = 99\n)\n  val results4 = snc.sql(\nSELECT * FROM ROW_TABLE\n)\n  println(\ncontents of row table are after setting col1 = 100 are:\n)\n  results4.foreach(println)\n\n\n\n\nRunning Spark programs inside the database\n\n\n\n\nNote: Above simple example uses local mode(i.e. development mode) to create tables and update data. In the production environment, users will want to deploy the SnappyData system as a unified cluster (default cluster model that consists of servers that embed colocated Spark executors and Snappy stores, locators, and a job server enabled lead node) or as a split cluster (where Spark executors and Snappy stores form independent clusters). Refer to the  \ndeployments\n chapter for all the supported deployment modes and the \nconfiguration\n chapter for configuring the cluster.\n\n\n\n\nTo create a job that can be submitted through the job server, the job must implement the \nSnappySQLJob or SnappyStreamingJob\n trait. Your job will look like:\n\n\nclass SnappySampleJob implements SnappySQLJob {\n  /** Snappy uses this as an entry point to execute Snappy jobs. **/\n  def runJob(sc: SnappyContext, jobConfig: Config): Any\n\n  /** SnappyData calls this function to validate the job input and reject invalid job requests **/\n  def validate(sc: SnappyContext, config: Config): SparkJobValidation\n}\n\n\n\n\nclass SnappyStreamingSampleJob implements SnappyStreamingJob {\n  /** Snappy uses this as an entry point to execute Snappy jobs. **/\n  def runJob(sc: SnappyStreamingContext, jobConfig: Config): Any\n\n  /** SnappyData calls this function to validate the job input and reject invalid job requests **/\n  def validate(sc: SnappyContext, config: Config): SparkJobValidation\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nJob\n traits are simply extensions of the \nSparkJob\n implemented by \nSpark JobServer\n. \n\n\n\n\n\u2022 \nrunJob\n contains the implementation of the Job. The SnappyContext/SnappyStreamingContext is managed by the SnappyData Leader (which runs an instance of Spark JobServer) and will be provided to the job through this method. This relieves the developer from the boiler-plate configuration management that comes with the creation of a Spark job and allows the Job Server to manage and re-use contexts.\n\n\n\u2022 \nvalidate\n allows for an initial validation of the context and any provided configuration. If the context and configuration are OK to run the job, returning spark.jobserver.SparkJobValid will let the job execute, otherwise returning spark.jobserver.SparkJobInvalid(reason) prevents the job from running and provides means to convey the reason of failure. In this case, the call immediately returns an HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request status code.\u2028validate helps you preventing running jobs that will eventually fail due to missing or wrong configuration and save both time and resources.\n\n\nSee \nexamples\n for Spark and spark streaming jobs. \n\n\nSnappySQLJob trait extends the SparkJobBase trait. It provides users the singleton SnappyContext object that may be reused across jobs. SnappyContext singleton object creates one SQLContext per incomig SQL connection. Similarly SnappyStreamingJob provides users access to SnappyStreamingContext object that can be reused across jobs\n\n\nSubmitting jobs\n\n\nFollowing command submits \nCreateAndLoadAirlineDataJob\n from the \nsnappy-examples\n directory.   This job creates dataframes from parquet files, loads the data from dataframe into column tables and row tables and creates sample table on column table in its runJob method.

            "text": "Note: Above simple example uses local mode(i.e. development mode) to create tables and update data. In the production environment, users will want to deploy the SnappyData system as a unified cluster (default cluster model that consists of servers that embed colocated Spark executors and Snappy stores, locators, and a job server enabled lead node) or as a split cluster (where Spark executors and Snappy stores form independent clusters). Refer to the   deployments  chapter for all the supported deployment modes and the  configuration  chapter for configuring the cluster.   To create a job that can be submitted through the job server, the job must implement the  SnappySQLJob or SnappyStreamingJob  trait. Your job will look like:  class SnappySampleJob implements SnappySQLJob {\n  /** Snappy uses this as an entry point to execute Snappy jobs. **/\n  def runJob(sc: SnappyContext, jobConfig: Config): Any\n\n  /** SnappyData calls this function to validate the job input and reject invalid job requests **/\n  def validate(sc: SnappyContext, config: Config): SparkJobValidation\n}  class SnappyStreamingSampleJob implements SnappyStreamingJob {\n  /** Snappy uses this as an entry point to execute Snappy jobs. **/\n  def runJob(sc: SnappyStreamingContext, jobConfig: Config): Any\n\n  /** SnappyData calls this function to validate the job input and reject invalid job requests **/\n  def validate(sc: SnappyContext, config: Config): SparkJobValidation\n}   The  Job  traits are simply extensions of the  SparkJob  implemented by  Spark JobServer .    \u2022  runJob  contains the implementation of the Job. The SnappyContext/SnappyStreamingContext is managed by the SnappyData Leader (which runs an instance of Spark JobServer) and will be provided to the job through this method. This relieves the developer from the boiler-plate configuration management that comes with the creation of a Spark job and allows the Job Server to manage and re-use contexts.  \u2022  validate  allows for an initial validation of the context and any provided configuration. If the context and configuration are OK to run the job, returning spark.jobserver.SparkJobValid will let the job execute, otherwise returning spark.jobserver.SparkJobInvalid(reason) prevents the job from running and provides means to convey the reason of failure. In this case, the call immediately returns an HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request status code.\u2028validate helps you preventing running jobs that will eventually fail due to missing or wrong configuration and save both time and resources.  See  examples  for Spark and spark streaming jobs.   SnappySQLJob trait extends the SparkJobBase trait. It provides users the singleton SnappyContext object that may be reused across jobs. SnappyContext singleton object creates one SQLContext per incomig SQL connection. Similarly SnappyStreamingJob provides users access to SnappyStreamingContext object that can be reused across jobs",

            "text": "Approximate Query processing (AQP)\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nData volumes from transactional and non transactional sources have been growing exponentially. Cleansing, transforming and storing such large data sets present significant challenges in itself. Querying large data sets in real time using optimizations like columnar storage, compression and horizontal scaling, while necessary, are simply linear improvements to an exponential problem and discourages practitioners from exploring large data sets through querying, because query response times are very large. \n\n\nApproximate query processing offers an exponential solution to the data volume problem. The basic idea behind approximate query processing is that one can use statistical sampling techniques and probabilistic data structures to answer aggregate class queries without needing to store or operate over the entire data set. The approach trades off query accuracy for quicker response times, allowing for queries to be run on large data sets with meaningful and accurate error information. A real world example here would be the use of political polls run by Gallup and others where a small sample is used to estimate support for a candidate within a small margin of error. \n\n\nIts important to note that not all SQL queries can be answered through AQP, but by moving a subset of queries hitting the database to the AQP module, the system as a whole becomes more responsive and usable.\n\n\nApproximations Technique 1: Synopses\n\n\nSynopses data structures are typically much smaller than the base data sets that they represent. They use very little space and provide fast, approximate answers to queries. A \nBloomFilter\n is a commonly used example of a synopsis data structure. Another example of a synopsis structure is a \nCount-Min-Sketch\n which serves as a frequency table of events in a stream of data. The ability to use Time as a dimension for querying makes synopses structures very interesting. As streams are ingested, all relevant synopses are updated incrementally and can be queried using SQL or the Scala API.\n\n\nCreating TopK tables\n\n\nTopK queries are used to rank attributes to answer \"best, most interesting, most important\" class of questions.TopK structures store elements ranking them based on their relevance to the query. \nTopK\n queries aim to retrieve, from a potentially very large resultset, only the \nk (k \n= 1)\n best answers  \n\n\nSQL API for creating a TopK table in SnappyData\n \n\n\nsnsc.sql(\ncreate topK table MostPopularTweets on tweetStreamTable \n +\n        \noptions(key 'hashtag', frequencyCol 'retweets')\n)\n\n\n\n\nThe example above create a TopK table called MostPopularTweets, the base table for which is tweetStreamTable. It uses the hashtag field of tweetStreamTable as its key field and maintains the TopN hashtags that have the highest retweets value in the base table. This works for both static tables and streaming tables\n\n\nScala API for creating a TopK table\n  \n\n\nval topKOptionMap = Map(\n    \"epoch\" -\n System.currentTimeMillis().toString,\n    \"timeInterval\" -\n \"1000ms\",\n    \"size\" -\n \"40\",\n        \"frequencyCol\" -\n \"retweets\",\n    \"basetable\" -\n \"tweetStreamTable\"\n\n  )\n  val schema = StructType(List(StructField(\"HashTag\", StringType)))\n  snc.createApproxTSTopK(\"MostPopularTweets\", \"HashTag\",\n    schema, topKOptionMap)\n\n\n\nThe code above shows how to do the same thing using the SnappyData Scala API  \n\n\nQuerying the TopK table\n  \n\n\nselect * from topkTweets order by EstimatedValue desc\n\n\n\nThe example above queries the TopK table which returns the top 40 (the depth of the TopK table was set to 40) hashtags with the most retweets.\n\n\nApproximate TopK analytics for time series data\n\n\nTime is used as an attribute in creating the TopK structures. Time can be an attribute of the incoming data set (which is frequently the case with streaming data sets) and in the absence of that, the system uses arrival time of the batch as the timestamp for that incoming batch. The TopK structure is populated along the dimension of time. As an example, the most retweeted hashtags in each window are stored in the data structure. This allows us to issue queries like, \"what are the most popular hashtags in a given time interval?\" Queries of this nature are typically difficult to execute and not easy to optimize (due to space considerations)in a traditional system.\n\n\nHere is an example of a time based query on the TopK structure which returns the most popular hashtags in the time interval queried. The SnappyData AQP module provides two attributes startTime and endTime which can be used to run queries on arbitrary time intervals.\n\n\nselect hashtag, EstimatedValue, ErrorBoundsInfo from MostPopularTweets where \n    startTime='2016-01-26 10:07:26.121' and endTime='2016-01-26 11:14:06.121' \n    order by EstimatedValue desc\n\n\n\nIf time is an attribute in the incoming data set, it can be used instead of the system generated time. In order to do this, the TopK table creation is provided the name of the column containing the time stamp. \n\nSQL API for creating a TopK table in SnappyData specifying timestampColumn\n \n In the example below tweetTime is a field in the incoming dataset which carries the timestamp of the tweet.\n\n\nsnsc.sql(\ncreate topK table MostPopularTweets on tweetStreamTable \n +\n        \noptions(key 'hashtag', frequencyCol 'retweets', timeSeriesColumn 'tweetTime' )\n)\n\n\n\n\nThe example above create a TopK table called MostPopularTweets, the base table for which is tweetStreamTable. It uses the hashtag field of tweetStreamTable as its key field and maintains the TopN hashtags that have the highest retweets value in the base table. This works for both static tables and streaming tables\n\n\nScala API for creating a TopK table\n  \n\n\nval topKOptionMap = Map(\n    \"epoch\" -\n System.currentTimeMillis().toString,\n    \"timeInterval\" -\n \"1000ms\",\n    \"size\" -\n \"40\",\n        \"frequencyCol\" -\n \"retweets\",\n        \"timeSeriesColumn\" -\n \"tweetTime\"\n    \"basetable\" -\n \"tweetStreamTable\"\n\n  )\n  val schema = StructType(List(StructField(\"HashTag\", StringType)))\n  snc.createApproxTSTopK(\"MostPopularTweets\", \"HashTag\",\n    schema, topKOptionMap)\n\n\n\nThe code above shows how to do the same thing using the SnappyData Scala API  \n\n\nIt is worth noting that the user has the ability to disable time as a dimension if desired. This is done by not providing the \ntimeInterval\n attribute when creating the TopK table.\n\n\nApproximations Technique 2: Sampling\n\n\nThe basic idea behind sampling is the assumption that a representative sample of the base data set can be built such that it can provide answers to aggregate questions like SUM, AVG and COUNT fairly accurately and much more quicker than running the same query against the full data set. We use a combination of techniques to build the sample such that it is representative, random (is not biased) and contains under represented groups.\n\n\nThe two techniques that the SnappyData AQP module uses to accomplish this are reservoir sampling as applied to stratified sampling. \n\n\nReservoir sampling is a technique/set of algorithms for randomly choosing a sample of \nk\n items from a set S containing n items, where n is a small subset of n. While reservoir sampling delivers a uniform random sample, by itself, it does not have the ability to ensure that under represented groups in the data set are represented in the sample.\n\n\nThis is where stratified sampling comes in. Stratified sampling divides the population/data set into different non overlapping subgroups. Once the strata has been defined, we then use reservoir sampling within each subgroup to deliver uniform random samples.This works for large static data sets or streaming data sets. The process of stratification is driven by apriori knowledge of the query column sets that are expected in user queries.\n\n\nThe following DDL creates a sample that is 3% of the full data set and stratified on 3 columns\n \n\n\nCREATE SAMPLE TABLE AIRLINE_SAMPLE OPTIONS(\nbuckets '5',\nqcs 'UniqueCarrier, Year_, Month_',\nfraction '0.03',\nstrataReservoirSize '50',\nbasetable 'Airline') AS (\nSELECT Year_, Month_ , DayOfMonth,\n  DayOfWeek, DepTime, CRSDepTime, ArrTime, CRSArrTime,\n  UniqueCarrier, FlightNum, TailNum, ActualElapsedTime,\n  CRSElapsedTime, AirTime, ArrDelay, DepDelay, Origin,\n  Dest, Distance, TaxiIn, TaxiOut, Cancelled, CancellationCode,\n  Diverted, CarrierDelay, WeatherDelay, NASDelay, SecurityDelay,\n  LateAircraftDelay, ArrDelaySlot\nFROM AIRLINE);\n\n\n\nEquivalent Scala API for creating  the same sample table\n       \n\n\n String baseTable = \"AIRLINE\"       \n   // Create a sample table sampling parameters.\n  snc.createSampleTable(sampleTable, None,\n    Map(\"buckets\" -\n \"5\",\n      \"qcs\" -\n \"UniqueCarrier, Year_, Month_\",\n      \"fraction\" -\n \"0.03\",\n      \"strataReservoirSize\" -\n \"50\",\n      \"basetable\" -\n baseTable\n    ))\n    snc.table(baseTable).write.mode(SaveMode.Append).saveAsTable(sampleTable)\n\n\n\nHere is an example of a query that can be run after the sample table has been created.  \n\n\nSELECT sum(ArrDelay) ArrivalDelay, Month_ from airline group by Month_ order\n    by Month_  with error 0.10 confidence 0.95\n\n\n\nNote how the query specifies the acceptable error fraction and expected confidence interval. The table specified in the query is the base table, however the SnappyData AQP engine figures out that there are one or more appropriate sample tables that can be used to satisfy this query and transparently uses the sample table to satisfy the query.  \n\n\nHere is the scala API for running the same query     \n\n\nsnc.table(baseTable).agg(Map(\"ArrDelay\" -\n \"sum\")).withError(0.10, 0.95)\n\n\n\nThe withError method takes in both the error fraction and the expected confidence interval for the returned result.\n\n\nIn additiion to this, SnappyData supports error functions that can be specified in the query projection. Currently these error functions are supported for the SUM and AVG aggregates in the projection. The following four methods are available to be used in query projection when running approximate queries, and their definitions are self explanatory\n\n\n\n\nabsolute_error(\\\n)\n\n\nrelative_error(\\\n)\n\n\nlower_bound(\\\n)\n\n\nupper_bound(\\\n)\n\n\n\n\nThe query below depicts an example of using error functions in query projections \n\n\nselect AVG(ArrDelay) arrivalDelay, relative_error(arrivalDelay), absolute_error(arrivalDelay),\nYear_ from airline group by Year_ order by Year_ with error 0.10 confidence 0.95;\n\n\n\n\nSome of the error rates on queries can be high enough to render the query result meaningless. To deal with this, SnappyData offers the ability to set a configuration parameter that governs whether the query fails when the error rate condition cannot be met or whether it should still return the results in such conditions. In the future we expect to change this behavior to allow the user to further specifiy whether the query should be transparently run against the full data set if available.\n\n\nUsing AQP\n\n\nApproximate query processing offers the potential for order of magnitude improvements in big data query processing but it is by no means a panacea to all big data queries. The use of AQP is predicated on proper strata selection for sample generation and that in turn is a function of the queries that the system is expected to handle. Using regions or states as strata for queries involving customers offers the potential for providing manageable subgroups (50 states) with the potential for enough sample data in each subgroup to allow sampling to work. Using customer id as the strata in the same scenario would simply not be feasible. \n\n\nIn the current release AQP queries only work for SUM, AVG and COUNT aggregations not involving joins. The SnappyData AQP module will gradually expand the scope of queries that can be serviced through it. But the overarching goal here is to make enough of a dent in query processing by diverting at least some queries to the sampling subsystem and allowing better data exploration.",

Cleansing, transforming and storing such large data sets present significant challenges in itself. Querying large data sets in real time using optimizations like columnar storage, compression and horizontal scaling, while necessary, are simply linear improvements to an exponential problem and discourages practitioners from exploring large data sets through querying, because query response times are very large.   Approximate query processing offers an exponential solution to the data volume problem. The basic idea behind approximate query processing is that one can use statistical sampling techniques and probabilistic data structures to answer aggregate class queries without needing to store or operate over the entire data set. The approach trades off query accuracy for quicker response times, allowing for queries to be run on large data sets with meaningful and accurate error information. A real world example here would be the use of political polls run by Gallup and others where a small sample is used to estimate support for a candidate within a small margin of error.   Its important to note that not all SQL queries can be answered through AQP, but by moving a subset of queries hitting the database to the AQP module, the system as a whole becomes more responsive and usable.",

Data can be ingested from many sources like Kafka, Flume, Twitter, ZeroMQ, Kinesis, or TCP sockets, and can be processed using complex\u2028algorithms expressed with high-level functions like \nmap\n, \nreduce\n, \njoin\n and \nwindow\n.\n\n\nFinally, processed data can be pushed out to filesystems, databases,\u2028and live dashboards. In fact, you can apply Spark's \nmachine learning\n and \ngraph processing\n algorithms on data streams.\u2028\u2028\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nInternally, it works as follows. Spark Streaming receives live input data streams and divides the data into batches, which are then processed by the Spark engine to generate the final stream of results in batches.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nSpark Streaming provides a high-level abstraction called \ndiscretized stream\n or \nDStream\n,\u2028which represents a continuous stream of data. DStreams can be created either from input data\u2028streams from sources such as Kafka, Flume, and Kinesis, or by applying high-level\u2028operations on other DStreams. Internally, a DStream is represented as a sequence of\u2028\nRDDs\n.\u2028\n\n\nAdditional details on the Spark Streaming concepts and programming is covered \nhere\n.\n\n\nSnappyData Streaming extensions over Spark\n\n\nWe offer the following enhancements over Spark Streaming : \n\n\n\n\n\n\nManage Streams declaratively\n: Similar to SQL Tables, Streams can be defined declaratively from any SQL client and managed as Tables in the persistent system catalog of SnappyStore. The declarative language follows the SQL language and provides access to the any of the Spark Streaming streaming adapters such as Kafka or file input streams. Raw tuples arriving can be transformed into a proper structure through pluggable transformers providing the desired flexibility for custom filtering or type conversions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSQL based stream processing\n: With streams visible as Tables they can be joined with other streams or resident tables (reference data, history, etc). Essentially, the entire SQL language can be used to analyze distributed streams. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuous queries and time windows\n: Similar to popular stream processing products, applications can register \u201ccontinuous\u201d queries on streams. By default, spark streaming emits batches once every second and any registered queries would be executed each time a batch is emitted.

            "text": "Spark Streaming is an extension of the core Spark API that enables scalable, high-throughput, fault-tolerant stream processing of live data streams. Data can be ingested from many sources like Kafka, Flume, Twitter, ZeroMQ, Kinesis, or TCP sockets, and can be processed using complex\u2028algorithms expressed with high-level functions like  map ,  reduce ,  join  and  window .  Finally, processed data can be pushed out to filesystems, databases,\u2028and live dashboards. In fact, you can apply Spark's  machine learning  and  graph processing  algorithms on data streams.\u2028\u2028  \n     Internally, it works as follows. Spark Streaming receives live input data streams and divides the data into batches, which are then processed by the Spark engine to generate the final stream of results in batches.  \n  \n   Spark Streaming provides a high-level abstraction called  discretized stream  or  DStream ,\u2028which represents a continuous stream of data. DStreams can be created either from input data\u2028streams from sources such as Kafka, Flume, and Kinesis, or by applying high-level\u2028operations on other DStreams. Internally, a DStream is represented as a sequence of\u2028 RDDs .\u2028  Additional details on the Spark Streaming concepts and programming is covered  here .",

The declarative language follows the SQL language and provides access to the any of the Spark Streaming streaming adapters such as Kafka or file input streams. Raw tuples arriving can be transformed into a proper structure through pluggable transformers providing the desired flexibility for custom filtering or type conversions.     SQL based stream processing : With streams visible as Tables they can be joined with other streams or resident tables (reference data, history, etc). Essentially, the entire SQL language can be used to analyze distributed streams.     Continuous queries and time windows : Similar to popular stream processing products, applications can register \u201ccontinuous\u201d queries on streams. By default, spark streaming emits batches once every second and any registered queries would be executed each time a batch is emitted. To support arbitrary time ranges, we extend the standard SQL to be able to specify the time window for the query.     OLAP optimizations : By integrating and collocating stream processing with our hybrid in-memory storage engine, we leverage our optimizer and column store for expensive scans and aggregations, while providing fast key-based operations with our row store.    Reduced shuffling through co-partitioning : With SnappyData, the partitioning key used by the input queue (e.g., for Kafka sources), the stream processor and the underlying store can all be the same. This dramatically reduces the need to shuffle records.    Approximate stream analytics : When the volumes are too high, a stream can be summarized using various forms of samples and sketches to enable fast time series analytics.
